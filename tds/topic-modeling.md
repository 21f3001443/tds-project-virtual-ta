## Topic Modeling

<youtube_summary>The discussion explains embeddings in large language models (LLMs), which convert text into numerical arrays (vectors) where similar meanings correspond to vectors close in multi-dimensional space. These embeddings enable semantic similarity comparisons, such as grouping words by meaning (e.g., countries like Singapore close to Malaysia). Visualization tools like TensorFlow Projector reduce high-dimensional embeddings to 3D for interpretation.

The example task is classifying words (apple, orange, banana, Jamaica, Sri Lanka, Facebook, Google) into categories (fruit, country, company) using embeddings rather than direct GPT classification for cost-effectiveness and precision. OpenAI's API allows creating embeddings by sending text input and specifying models—various models yield different embedding results. Earlier methods like word2vec used simpler presence-based vectors, while modern embeddings capture conceptual similarity in fewer dimensions (e.g., 1,536 numbers instead of tens of thousands).

Using Python, embeddings are obtained via OpenAI’s API, stored as numpy arrays, and similarity between words computed using dot products (a measure correlating with semantic similarity). A pairwise similarity matrix can be created and visualized with pandas and conditional formatting. Clustering algorithms like K-means help group similar words automatically, confirming expected groupings (fruits, countries, companies).

Comparing costs, embedding-based classification is significantly cheaper (~6 cents per million tokens) than direct GPT model usage (~$45 per million tokens), making embeddings scalable for large datasets.

The conversation also covers running embeddings locally using models from the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) leaderboard, like Sentence Transformers, which produce embeddings of different dimensions (e.g., 1,024) with values typically ranging from -1 to +1. Cosine similarity is recommended over dot product for more reliable similarity measurement.

Differences between models appear in classification results, e.g., some models classify "banana" closer to a company or country, illustrating model-specific biases. Despite variations, embeddings provide consistent, quantitative measures of semantic similarity.

In summary, embeddings transform text into numerical form capturing semantic meaning, enabling efficient similarity computation, classification, and clustering. They offer a powerful, cost-effective tool for natural language understanding and are considered an underutilized strength of large language models.</youtube_summary>
