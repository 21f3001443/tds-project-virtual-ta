Once you've prepared the data, your next task is to analyze it to get insights that are not immediately obvious.

In this module, you'll learn:

- **Statistical analysis**: Calculate correlations, regressions, forecasts, and outliers using **spreadsheets**
- **Data summarization**: Aggregate and pivot data using **Python** and **databases**.
- **Geo-data Collection & Processing**: Gather and process geospatial data using tools like Python (GeoPandas) and QGIS.
- **Geo-visualization**: Create and visualize geospatial data on maps using Excel, QGIS, and Python libraries such as Folium.
- **Network & Proximity Analysis**: Analyze geospatial relationships and perform network analysis to understand data distribution and clustering.
- **Storytelling & Decision Making**: Develop narratives and make informed decisions based on geospatial data insights.

<youtube_summary>This module covers data modeling tools across three areas: Excel, Python, and other tools.

1. **Excel**: Focuses on correlation, regression, and outlier detection using COVID data as an example.
   - *Correlation* measures how often two variables move together (e.g., student scores in physics and mathematics).
   - *Regression* measures the effect size (e.g., how much a 1-mark increase in chemistry affects physics scores).
   - *Outliers* identify exceptions, such as students scoring high in mathematics but poorly in physics.

2. **Python**: Covers classification, forecasting, and clustering with various datasets.
   - *Classification* assigns data points to groups (e.g., deciding loan eligibility based on historical data).
   - *Forecasting* predicts future values using time series data (e.g., stock prices influenced by trends and seasonality).
   - *Clustering* groups similar items based on multiple variables (e.g., grouping stocks with similar behaviors).

3. **Other Tools**: Includes R/R Studio, Rattle, and PyCaret.
   - *R and R Studio* are widely used for data modeling.
   - *Rattle* is a non-programmatic R-based tool for data analysis without coding.
   - *PyCaret* is a Python-based tool that automatically builds and compares models for quick exploration.

Overall, the module aims to teach various tools and techniques for building data models that reveal insights not immediately obvious from raw data.</youtube_summary>
