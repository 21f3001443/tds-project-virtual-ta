<youtube_summary>The session involved a detailed Q&A on various topics related to a TDS (Tools and Data Science) course, covering foundational technologies, course tools, assignments, and technical issues faced by students.

Key points discussed:

1. **Foundational Technologies for TDS**:  
   - Recommended basics to learn include CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Bash and Shell scripting, REST APIs, and a major scripting language like Python or JavaScript.  
   - These basics help in understanding and progressing through the course effectively.  
   - Tools and scripts like Git, Bash, REST API, and FastAPI come as supporting technologies that can be learned on the go based on the purpose and utility.  
   - Emphasis on learning tools to a practical extent rather than in-depth expertise, focusing on fulfilling the purpose of tasks.

2. **Course Structure and Tools**:  
   - The course is divided into sections such as web scraping (requiring CSS, HTML, JavaScript/Python), scripting, and deployment (involving Bash or REST API).  
   - The approach is to understand the purpose, then the technique, followed by the tool or technology.  
   - All required tools and techniques are arranged sequentially and appropriately for the course’s needs.

3. **Docker Usage**:  
   - Students asked if Docker images can be used via an online Docker account or if downloading desktop software is necessary.  
   - Answer: You need to deploy Docker images, which requires running Docker either locally or on cloud environments like Google Colab’s Linux runtime.

4. **Vercel Deployment Issues**:  
   - Students faced a 404 error when deploying projects on Vercel linked to GitHub.  
   - Suggested posting detailed error screenshots and info on the course’s discussion forum (Discourse) for troubleshooting.

5. **Assignment and Exam Internet Usage**:  
   - All graded assignments and take-home projects allow open internet access for research and collaboration.  
   - The only no-internet scenario is the final in-person exam.

6. **GitHub Account Issues**:  
   - Some students struggled with creating or signing into GitHub accounts using their institutional email (IIT email).  
   - Advice: Must sign up first with a unique username (email address is separate from username), complete verification, and then sign in.  
   - Personal GitHub accounts can be used, but it’s recommended to clarify with instructors.  
   - Issues with username availability and verification were common; students were advised to post problems with screenshots on Discourse for help.

7. **Image Compression Assignment Issue**:  
   - A student reported errors related to image size and pixel mismatch despite using recommended browsers and image formats.  
   - The problem was unique and not reproducible by instructors; students were encouraged to post details on Discourse for further investigation.

8. **Course Project Selection**:  
   - TDS projects are integrated within the main course portal and automatically assigned; there is no separate selection process like other courses.

9. **Evaluation Script Updates**:  
   - Updates to evaluation scripts might cover additional corner cases but do not invalidate previously correct submissions.  
   - Students should not worry but may recheck their answers as practice.

10. **Submission Procedures**:  
    - Projects and assignments are submitted via GitHub repositories and Google Forms as per instructions.

11. **Markdown and AI Tools**:  
    - Markdown syntax is used for formatting reports and documents; students can use any public URLs for images and links.  
    - Use of AI tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Perplexity Pro is allowed, but understanding the underlying concepts is important.

12. **Passing Criteria for Graded Assignments**:  
    - To pass graded assignments (out of 10 points), students need to score at least 4 points to qualify for the end-term exam.

13. **JSON and Query Validation Issues**:  
    - Some students faced validation errors with JSON sorting or query answers despite manual and AI validation.  
    - Recommended to post issues on Discourse with email IDs and screenshots for backend verification.

14. **Windows and WSL Issues**:  
    - Students using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) had trouble with file handling and command execution, leading to incorrect answers.  
    - Suggested trying Google Colab or posting problems on Discourse for support.

15. **Deadline Extensions**:  
    - No extension for GA1 deadline; students encouraged to use alternative environments like Colab if facing technical issues.

16. **General Recommendations**:  
    - Students should post technical issues and doubts on the course discussion forum (Discourse) with detailed information for timely support.  
    - Understanding the purpose behind tools and techniques is emphasized over deep expertise in all topics.  
    - Live sessions recordings are uploaded to YouTube within a day; students can request access if not found.

The session concluded with an encouragement to use the discussion portal for unresolved issues and to focus on practical learning aligned with course objectives.</youtube_summary>
)

**Q1: What are the essential base technologies to learn for the TDS course?**

**A1:** Focus on these three areas: 1) Bash and shell scripting; 2) Git; 3) CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Also, learn REST APIs. Other tools can be learned on the go once you have a basic understanding of these core technologies.

**Q2: Regarding the tools and techniques needed for the TDS course, are Bash and shell scripting, Git, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and REST APIs the only essential ones?**

**A2:** Yes, those are the core technologies. Other tools are supplementary and can be learned as needed throughout the course. The instructor suggests a three-part approach to learning: 1) Define the purpose; 2) Determine the technique; 3) Select the tools.

**Q3: In short, is it sufficient to learn the listed technologies to a certain depth, not necessarily to the level of a diploma?**

**A3:** Yes, learning to a certain depth is sufficient. The learning process should always be purpose-driven. You don't need to become an expert in any one tool; you need to know how to use it to accomplish your task.

**Q4: For the last two questions in Week 2 (the Llama file and the Docker file), do we need to install the applications or can we do it online?**

**A4:** For the Llama file, you don't need to download anything. For the Docker file, you can use online tools like Google Colab, which provides a Linux environment. You can run Docker directly in Colab.

**Q5: I deployed a project via GitHub, but I'm getting a 404 error. Why?**

**A5:** A 404 error means the page isn't found. The instructor suggests posting a screenshot and your email ID on the Discourse forum for more detailed debugging.

**Q6: In the Llama file question, the URL shows the correct answer initially, but after refreshing, it shows an incorrect answer. Why?**

**A6:** Post a screenshot and your email ID on the Discourse forum. This will allow the instructor to check the backend and the script to determine the cause.

**Q7: Are the graded assignments open internet or closed internet?**

**A7:** All graded assignments are open internet, except for the final in-person exam, which is closed internet.

**Q8: I'm having trouble signing into GitHub with my IIT email. Is GitHub only available for personal emails?**

**A8:** GitHub is available for any email. You need to sign up first, then sign in. For evaluation purposes, your submissions will be linked to the email address you use to log in. The instructor recommends signing up with your IIT email.

**Q9: For the GitHub question, if I've signed in with a personal ID but also have an IIT ID, will that be a problem?**

**A9:** There shouldn't be a problem. The instructor recommends using your IIT email for evaluation purposes.

**Q10: In the graded assignment 2, image compression, I'm getting an error: "Could not process the image. Is it browser supported? Image pixels do not match the original." I've tried several ways, including using Photoshop to ensure the image resolution is the same. What's wrong?**

**A10:** The image size should be less than 1,300,000 bytes. The instructor will make a note of this issue and investigate. The error may be browser-related, so trying a different browser might help. The instructor also requests the Discourse link be shared.

**Q11: For the TDS project, do we have to choose the project, or will it be added to our course by default?**

**A11:** The TDS project is part of the course and will be automatically added. It's not a separate project like in other courses.

**Q12: Should I be worried that the evaluation scripts might be updated after I submit my answers, potentially changing my grade?**

**A12:** No, the evaluation scripts are updated to address additional corner cases, but the randomization of questions means that the changes are unlikely to affect your grade. The instructor suggests checking your answers again using GA2 as an exercise.

**Q13: How will we submit Project 1? Will it be via Google Form?**

**A13:** Yes, Project 1 will be submitted via Google Form. The deliverable will be a GitHub repository.

**Q14: I'm using Windows, but many questions require Ubuntu. I copied the downloaded files to my WSL home folder, but I'm not getting the correct answers. Is it possible to install a Windows system in Linux?**

**A14:** You can use WSL. The instructor asks for a screenshot to debug the issue. The student explains that they copied the files (a.txt and b.txt) to a TDS folder in their Ubuntu WSL environment. The `diff` command shows 40 lines of difference, but the submission is not accepted. The instructor suggests posting this on the Discourse forum.

**Q15: Question 16 in GA1 (rename files) is not accepting my answer, even though I've tried using ChatGPT. What's wrong?**

**A15:** The instructor suggests posting this on the Discourse forum with your email ID. The instructor notes that many submissions are randomized, so the issue may be related to the specific randomized version of the question.
