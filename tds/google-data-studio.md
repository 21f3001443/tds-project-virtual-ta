<youtube_summary>This comprehensive tutorial by Sergey, a Product Expert at Railsware, introduces beginners to Google Data Studio as an efficient, cost-effective tool for building custom dashboards, especially suitable for small to medium businesses or corporate departments. Unlike expensive BI tools or limited simpler solutions, Google Data Studio enables quick creation and sharing of visually appealing reports.

Key topics covered include setting up the Data Studio environment, creating and managing data sources, and building and sharing reports. The example project is a Recruitment Dashboard built from scratch using data imported from the Pipedrive applicant tracking system into Google Sheets via Coupler.io, as Pipedrive lacks a direct Data Studio connector. Best practices for preparing data in Google Sheets are emphasized, such as avoiding merged cells, using a single row per record, and having consistent data types per column.

The tutorial explains core Data Studio concepts: Data Sources (modifiable blueprints of connectors), Connectors (interfaces to platforms like BigQuery, YouTube, Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, Spreadsheets), Reports, and Explorers (currently in beta). It highlights the many-to-many relationship between data sources and reports.

In Data Studio, users create data sources by connecting to Google Sheets, adjust field data types (e.g., setting country as a geographic dimension or salary as currency), and add calculated fields. The report canvas includes tools for adding charts, tables, and controls, with options for multiple pages and customizable layout and themes.

The tutorial guides through creating a candidate list table with dimensions like name, position, application date, recruiter, location, and stage. It covers fixing broken tables caused by renaming columns by refreshing data sources and managing dimensions. Column sizing, ordering, and aggregation functions (SUM, AVERAGE, MEDIAN, MIN, MAX) are explained, including how to enable full aggregation options.

Styling tips include removing row numbers, adjusting text styles, and wrapping text. The tutorial demonstrates creating an aggregated salary statistics table showing minimum, maximum, median, average salaries, and applicant counts per position, using heatmaps and customized colors for clarity.

Filters play a crucial role: date range controls allow filtering data by timeframes (e.g., this quarter, this year), while filter controls enable filtering by dimensions like country or recruiter. Filters can apply locally (to single charts) or globally (to entire pages). The tutorial shows setting filters for stages like ‚ÄúProfile Review‚Äù and combining multiple filters using AND/OR logic. Tables can be set to act as interactive filters for other charts.

Additional pages demonstrate geographic visualizations with geomaps showing applicant distribution by country, including zoom and filter interactions. Another page features charts and scorecards: scorecards display aggregated metrics with comparison to previous periods, treemaps show application proportions per position with drill-down by recruiter, bar charts visualize daily application counts stacked by position, and line charts show overall daily applicant trends. Sorting, styling, and filtering are applied consistently.

The tutorial also briefly covers adding text, images (logos), and embedded web pages to reports, along with theme customization (light/dark modes).

In summary, Sergey provides a detailed, step-by-step guide to effectively using Google Data Studio for recruitment analytics, emphasizing practical tips for data preparation, report building, filtering, styling, and interactivity.
