## Browser: DevTools

[Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overview/) is the de facto standard for web development and data analysis in the browser.
You'll use this a lot when debugging and inspecting web pages.

Here are the key features you'll use most:

1. **Elements Panel**

   - Inspect and modify HTML/CSS in real-time
   - Copy CSS selectors for web scraping
   - Debug layout issues with the Box Model

   ```javascript
   // Copy selector in Console
   copy($0); // Copies selector of selected element
   ```

2. **Console Panel**

   - JavaScript REPL environment
   - Log and debug data
   - Common console methods:

   ```javascript
   console.table(data); // Display data in table format
   console.group("Name"); // Group related logs
   console.time("Label"); // Measure execution time
   ```

3. **Network Panel**
   - Monitor API requests and responses
   - Simulate slow connections
   - Right-click on a request and select "Copy as fetch" to get the request.
4. **Essential Keyboard Shortcuts**
   - `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows) / `Cmd+Opt+I` (Mac): Open DevTools
   - `Ctrl+Shift+C`: Select element to inspect
   - `Ctrl+L`: Clear console
   - `$0`: Reference currently selected element
   - `$$('selector')`: Query selector all (returns array)

- [Fun & powerful: Intro to Chrome DevTools](https://youtu.be/t1c5tNPpXjs
<youtube_summary>This video, presented by Jecelyn Yeen, introduces Chrome DevTools as a powerful tool for web development and debugging. It begins by showing how to easily access DevTools, such as right-clicking a webpage and selecting Inspect, noting there are over five ways to open it. The video focuses on six essential features to get started:

1. Elements Panel: Use the Inspect button to highlight and examine DOM elements, view and edit CSS styles live, and visualize the box model (size, padding, border, margin). You can also simulate mobile device views like Pixel 7 using device mode.

2. Console Panel: Displays log messages and errors, helping identify issues in code. You can click error links to open the Sources panel and set breakpoints for step-by-step debugging. The console also serves as a JavaScript playground for running scripts and experimenting, with shortcuts like the dollar sign ($) representing document.querySelector().

3. Sources Panel: Allows setting breakpoints to pause code execution and debug interactively. Pro tip: You can edit code directly in DevTools by setting up a workspace.

4. Network Panel: Monitors network activity when loading a webpage, filtering request types (CSS, images, etc.), and detecting errors like 404 status codes. It also allows simulating slow network conditions to test user experience.

Additional tips include learning keyboard shortcuts for faster testing and customizing DevTools with themes, languages, and shortcuts for improved productivity.

The video encourages viewers to explore further via linked resources, guides, and tutorials, and invites engagement through comments and social media. It concludes by welcoming users to the web development community and wishing them happy debugging.</youtube_summary>

- [Different ways to open Chrome DevTools](https://youtu.be/X65TAP8a530
<youtube_summary>This video explains various ways to open and use Chrome DevTools efficiently, with a focus on keyboard shortcuts and UI methods.

Key points include:

1. Keyboard Shortcuts:
   - Use Command+Option+C (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+C (Windows/Linux) to quickly open the Elements panel in inspect mode, allowing you to hover over elements and view their CSS.
   - Use Command+Option+J (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+J (Windows/Linux) to open the Console panel directly for JavaScript logging and execution.
   - Use Command+Option+I (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows/Linux) to open DevTools or reopen the last panel. This shortcut can also refresh panels like Network logging.
   - Remember shortcuts with the mnemonic: C for CSS (Elements), J for JavaScript (Console), and I for general DevTools.
   - The classic F12 key also opens DevTools; on some keyboards, press FN+F12.

2. UI Methods:
   - Click the three-dot menu in the top right corner of Chrome, select More Tools, then Developer Tools.
   - Right-click any element on a page and select Inspect to open the Elements panel.
   - On Mac, you can also use the View > Developer menu to access DevTools and see the shortcuts.

3. Advanced Tip:
   - You can automate opening DevTools on every new tab by running a Chrome command in the terminal with the flag `--auto-open-devtools-for-tabs`. Remember to quit Chrome before running this command.

- [Faster DevTools navigation with shortcuts and settings](https://youtu.be/xHusjrb_34A
<youtube_summary>Jecelyn Yeen shares useful shortcuts and settings for faster DevTools navigation. Press Escape to toggle the Drawer for quick Console access, and use the three-dot menu in the Drawer to open tabs like Rendering or Sensors more quickly than via More Tools. The Command menu (Command-Shift-P or Control-Shift-P) helps find functions easily, such as switching to dark theme or opening the CSS Overview panel, by typing keywords. Panels can be rearranged for frequent useâ€”for example, moving the Rendering tab to the top left or pairing CSS Overview with the Elements panel for efficient inspection. To prevent auto rearrangement of panels like the Styles pane when resizing, disable it under Settings by setting Panel layout to vertical. For customizing keyboard shortcuts, enable the Keyboard Shortcut Editor experiment in Experiments settings, reload DevTools, then edit shortcuts or match Visual Studio Code shortcuts in Shortcuts settings. Additional customization options like language and panel position are available at goo.gle/devtools-customize.</youtube_summary>

- [How to log messages in the Console](https://youtu.be/76U0gtuV9AY
<youtube_summary>In this episode, Jecelyn Yeen and Bramus Van Damme explore various ways to log messages to the browser Console beyond just using console.log in JavaScript.

- Opening the Console: Use Control-Shift-J (Linux/Windows) or Command-Option-J (Mac) in Chrome DevTools to open the Console, where logged messages appear along with file and line number info.
- Console as REPL: The Console can execute JavaScript code directly, allowing interaction with the current page, such as changing button labels dynamically.
- Log Levels: Messages can be logged at different levels:
  - console.log for info-level messages,
  - console.warn for warnings,
  - console.error for errors.
  These levels have distinct styles for easy recognition.
- Filtering Messages: The Console offers filtering via a Filter dropdown to show or hide messages by level. Additionally, the Console sidebar allows temporary filtering by message source (e.g., user messages or errors) but disables the dropdown filter while open.
- Clearing Messages: Use console.clear or the Clear Console button to remove all messages.
- Logging Variables: The Console can log all variable types (numbers, strings, arrays, objects). Objects and arrays can be expanded to inspect nested data.
- console.table: Logs arrays of objects as formatted tables for better overview.
- console.dir: Logs an object as a JSON-like representation, useful to see object details distinctly from console.log.
- Grouping Messages: Use console.group to visually group related messages, with console.groupCollapsed to start with groups collapsed. Groups can be nested and labeled for clarity.
- Additional Console Methods:
  - console.count and console.countReset to track how many times a function or event occurs,
  - console.trace to print a stack trace,
  - console.time and console.timeEnd to measure elapsed time between calls.
- For more details on Console APIs, visit goo.gle/devtools-console-api.

- [How to speed up your workflow with Console shortcuts](https://youtu.be/hdRDTj6ObiE
<youtube_summary>In this video, Sofia Emelianova and Jecelyn Yeen share useful Chrome DevTools Console utilities that help perform common tasks faster, noting these only work inside the Console and not in scripts.

Key points covered:

1. Dollar Sign Shortcuts:
   - $_ returns the value of the last evaluated expression.
   - $0 to $4 refer to the last five DOM elements selected in the Elements panel, with $0 being the most recent.
   
2. Query Selector Aliases:
   - $() is a shortcut for document.querySelector(), returning the first matching element.
   - $$() is a shortcut for document.querySelectorAll(), returning all matching elements as an array.
   - Both accept an optional second argument to specify the node to search within, which can be referenced using the $0-$4 shortcuts.

3. XPath Selection:
   - $x() lets you select elements via XPath expressions.
   - You can copy an elementâ€™s XPath from the Elements panel and use it as the argument.

4. Query Objects:
   - queryObjects(Constructor) retrieves all objects created by a specified constructor, e.g., queryObjects(Promise) lists all Promise objects on the page.

5. Console Logging Commands:
   - console.table() (shortcut: table) displays object data in a table format.
   - clear clears the Console (shortcut for console.clear).
   - console.dir() logs objects in an interactive tree format.

6. Extracting Object Keys and Values:
   - keys(object) returns all keys of an object.
   - values(object) returns all values.
   - copy() copies data to the clipboard for easy pasting elsewhere.

7. Monitoring Events and Functions:
   - getEventListeners($0) shows all event listeners on the currently selected element.
   - monitorEvents(target, eventName) logs specified events (e.g., window resize) to the Console.
   - unmonitorEvents(target) stops monitoring events.
   - monitor(functionName) logs calls to a specific function along with its arguments.
   - unmonitor(functionName) stops monitoring the function.

- [HTML vs DOM? Letâ€™s debug them](https://youtu.be/J-02VNxE7lE
<youtube_summary>This video explains the Document Object Model (DOM) and its relationship to HTML. When a browser requests a web page, the server returns HTML, which the browser processes to create the DOMâ€”a tree of objects representing the page's content. The DOM initially mirrors the HTML, but JavaScript can modify the DOM by adding, removing, or editing nodes, causing the DOM to differ from the original HTML. 

Developers can use browser DevTools to inspect and manipulate the DOM. The Elements panel shows the DOM tree, allowing inspection and editing of nodes. Useful features include right-clicking to inspect elements, searching the DOM with Ctrl/Cmd + F, and scrolling nodes into view. The console has special commands (like `$0` for the currently selected node and `$1` for the previously selected one) to help interact with DOM nodes.

Editing the DOM in DevTools is straightforward: double-click text to edit content, double-click node types to change them, right-click to add attributes (e.g., styles), and use "Edit as HTML" to insert HTML elements like anchors. You can also drag and drop nodes within the DOM tree. However, changes made in DevTools are temporary and lost upon reloading the page, as DevTools does not save edits to actual source files. To save changes, you must edit files directly in the Sources panel or your development environment.

The video encourages viewers to explore more about DOM manipulation via DevTools and provides links for further learning.</youtube_summary>

- [Caching demystified: Inspect, clear, and disable caches](https://youtu.be/mSMb-aH6sUw
<youtube_summary>The video explains various types of web caches and how to troubleshoot them using Chrome DevTools. Cache stores website files (images, styles, scripts) to speed up loading by avoiding re-downloading on revisit. The Network panel in DevTools shows cached resources and transferred data, highlighting faster load times on refresh. There are different cache types: memory cache (RAM-based, faster), disk cache, prefetch cache, and service worker cache.

Developers often need fresh content during development or after deployment. To clear cache, you can right-click any request in the Network panel and select "Clear Browser Cache," which clears all caches. Holding the Reload button in DevTools allows "Empty Cache and Hard Reload." The "Disable Cache" option forces no caching during refreshes but may slow performance if left on constantly, especially with tools like VITE or Backpack that use hot reloading and smart caching.

Service workers cache pages for offline use; their cache is visible and manageable in the Application panel under Cache Storage and Service Workers tabs. You can unregister service workers or bypass their cache temporarily for debugging. The Storage tab shows the space service workers use, and simulating low-storage quotas helps test site behavior on devices with limited storage.

Additionally, Chrome uses back and forward cache (bfcache) to speed up navigation without new network requests, visible in DevTools. Understanding these caches equips developers to debug effectively and optimize web performance.</youtube_summary>

Cache stores website files (images, styles, scripts) to speed up loading by avoiding re-downloading on revisit. The Network panel in DevTools shows cached resources and transferred data, highlighting faster load times on refresh. There are different cache types: memory cache (RAM-based, faster), disk cache, prefetch cache, and service worker cache.

Developers often need fresh content during development or after deployment. To clear cache, you can right-click any request in the Network panel and select "Clear Browser Cache," which clears all caches. Holding the Reload button in DevTools allows "Empty Cache and Hard Reload." The "Disable Cache" option forces no caching during refreshes but may slow performance if left on constantly, especially with tools like VITE or Backpack that use hot reloading and smart caching.

Service workers cache pages for offline use; their cache is visible and manageable in the Application panel under Cache Storage and Service Workers tabs. You can unregister service workers or bypass their cache temporarily for debugging. The Storage tab shows the space service workers use, and simulating low-storage quotas helps test site behavior on devices with limited storage.
