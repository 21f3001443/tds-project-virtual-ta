<youtube_summary>In this webinar hosted by Richard, the focus is on exploring animation options available in Flourish, a data visualization tool. Richard warmly welcomes attendees, wishes everyone a happy new year, and acknowledges recent challenges, noting optimism due to scientific advances. He introduces new customer success team members, Olivia and Helena, and mentions that the webinar series will now be bi-weekly instead of weekly.

The session emphasizes that animation in Flourish should serve to both engage and inform, aiding data storytelling through "object constancy"â€”tracking graphical elements through transitions to reduce cognitive load.

Richard reviews templates where animation is integral, such as the line chart race and bar chart race, highlighting their animation settings (noting differences in units like milliseconds vs seconds). He shows how to adjust animation duration for smooth or fast transitions and demonstrates how data size affects animation speed.

He then covers the linebar pi template, explaining animation controls for chart drawing and morphing in stories mode. He advises turning off animation when morphing unrelated charts to avoid misleading impressions. A key setting, "only animate series with the same name," is explained: it prevents confusing morphs between unrelated data series but can be disabled when morphing between related but differently named series, improving visual continuity.

In the scatter template, Richard stresses the importance of specifying the "name column" for animation to work properly. He introduces the "animation stagger" setting, which creates a staggered, stepwise animation effect, enhancing clarity. He also clarifies the difference between animation duration and timeline controls in time slider filters to avoid confusion.

Briefly, other templates are discussed: survey (with duration and stagger settings), heat map (fade and flip animations), spider/radar chart (drawing and morphing controlled by animation duration), and hierarchy (animation duration controls zoom speed).

Finally, Richard highlights the premium Data Explorer template available to enterprise customers, which offers advanced, impressive animations including morphing dots into maps and aggregating data groups, showcasing dynamic and insightful visual storytelling.

He encourages experimentation with animation settings to best tell data stories, invites questions via customer support, and closes by thanking attendees and expressing excitement for Flourish developments in 2021.</youtube_summary>
