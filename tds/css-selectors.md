## CSS Selectors

CSS selectors are patterns used to select and style HTML elements on a web page. They are fundamental to web development and data scraping, allowing you to precisely target elements for styling or extraction.

For data scientists, understanding CSS selectors is crucial when:

- Web scraping with tools like Beautiful Soup or Scrapy
- Selecting elements for browser automation with Selenium
- Styling data visualizations and web applications
- Debugging website issues using browser DevTools

<youtube_summary>This video tutorial by Kyle from Web Dev Simplified explains essential CSS selectors and how to use them effectively. It begins with the basics: 

- **Universal selector (*)** selects all elements.
- **Type selectors** select elements by their tag name (e.g., div, li, span).
- **Class selectors (.)** target elements with specific classes, which are flexible and commonly used.
- **ID selectors (#)** target elements with unique IDs but are less commonly used due to their one-per-page limitation.

Combining selectors allows for more specific targeting, such as selecting divs with a certain class by concatenating selectors without spaces (e.g., div.red) or using commas for OR logic (e.g., span, li.red).

The video covers **descendant selectors** (space between selectors) to style elements nested inside others, and **direct child selectors (>)** which select only immediate children. 

**Sibling selectors** are explained:
- The general sibling selector (~) selects all siblings after a specified element.
- The adjacent sibling selector (+) selects only the immediate next sibling.

Next, the tutorial introduces **pseudo-classes**, which style elements based on user interaction or position:
- Interaction-based: :hover, :focus, :checked, :disabled, :required.
- Structural: :first-child, :last-child, :nth-child(n), :only-child, :first-of-type, :last-of-type, :nth-of-type(n), :only-of-type.
- The powerful :not() pseudo-class negates a selector, selecting elements that do not match the specified selector.

**Pseudo-elements** covered include ::before and ::after, which insert content before or after an elementâ€™s content.

Finally, the video discusses **attribute selectors**, which select elements based on attributes or attribute values:
- Basic attribute presence: [data-red].
- Exact match: [data-red="true"].
- Partial matches:
  - Starts with (^=)
  - Ends with ($=)
  - Contains (*=)

The Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) provides detailed documentation on the three main types of selectors:

- [Basic CSS selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Basic_selectors): Learn about element (`div`), class (`.container`), ID (`#header`), and universal (`*`) selectors
- [Attribute selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Attribute_selectors): Target elements based on their attributes or attribute values (`[type="text"]`)
- [Combinators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Combinators): Use relationships between elements (`div > p`, `div + p`, `div ~ p`)
