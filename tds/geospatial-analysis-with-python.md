[![Geospatial analysis with Python](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/m_qayAJt-yE/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/m_qayAJt-yE
<youtube_summary>This tutorial demonstrates using geospatial analysis to aid decision-making for opening new businesses like restaurants, retail stores, bank branches, or airports, using Starbucks and McDonald's store coordinates in New York as a dataset.

Key steps include:

1. **Data Preparation**: Import libraries, read data containing store names, latitude, longitude, and addresses, and merge latitude and longitude into a single 'coordinates' column.

2. **Reference Location**: Obtain the latitude and longitude of the Empire State Building in New York from Google Maps to serve as the central reference point for analysis.

3. **Distance Calculation**: Using the geopy library's distance function, compute the distance of each store from the Empire State Building and add this as a new 'distance' column.

4. **Visualization**: Utilize the Python library folium to create a map centered at the Empire State Building, marking each store with colored markers—blue for McDonald's and green for Starbucks—allowing visual clustering and distribution analysis.

5. **Radius-Based Store Count**: Calculate how many stores exist within a specified radius (e.g., 10 kilometers) to assess market saturation in an area before opening a new store.

6. **Identifying Closest and Farthest Stores**: Group stores by brand and find the closest and farthest stores from the Empire State Building by aggregating minimum and maximum distances, respectively. Results showed McDonald's farthest store at 14 km, Starbucks at 13.9 km, and closest stores within a few dozen meters.

7. **Decision Making**: This analysis helps determine if opening a new store is viable based on proximity to competitors and store clustering, potentially reducing travel distance for customers.

8. **Mapping Specific Stores**: Finally, the closest and farthest stores are mapped to visualize their locations relative to the Empire State Building using the earlier mapping code with an updated dataset.

Overall, the tutorial guides through geospatial data manipulation, distance computations, visualization, and interpretation to support strategic decisions about opening new stores in a competitive urban environment.</youtube_summary>

- Learn about the [`geopy` package](https://pypi.org/project/geopy/) and [video](https://youtu.be/3jj_5kVmPLs
<youtube_summary>In this Python tutorial, we cover geocoding and distance measurement using the geopy library. Key points include:

1. **Geocoding an Address**: Using the Nominatim geocoder with a unique user agent, you can retrieve full address details, latitude, longitude, and raw location data from a single address.

2. **Geocoding Multiple Addresses**: For bulk geocoding, such as geolocating tallest buildings from a dataframe, the RateLimiter is used to respect Nominatim's usage policy of one request per second. The geocoder is applied to the address column, adding latitude and longitude as new dataframe columns.

3. **Reverse Geocoding**: You can get an address from latitude and longitude coordinates, demonstrated using airport data from the Vega datasets with Nominatim's reverse method.

4. **Using Different Geocoders**: Besides Nominatim, other services like Bing can be used by obtaining an API key and initializing the respective geocoder. This allows geocoding addresses and extracting latitude and longitude.

5. **Distance Calculation**: Geopy's distance module enables calculating the distance between two points using their latitude and longitude. An example computes distance between airports from a dataframe.

6. **Route Plotting with Dropdowns**: A final example shows plotting a route on a map between selected start and end locations (airports), displaying the calculated distance. The measured distance is compared with a tool for validation; results are close but may not exactly match.

Additional resources and documentation for geopy are available online. The tutorial emphasizes handling API usage policies responsibly and showcases practical geocoding and distance measurement applications.</youtube_summary>
