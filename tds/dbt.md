<youtube_summary>This video series introduces dbt (data build tool), an open-source project that manages the transformation part of an ELT process, blending software engineering automation with SQL. The creator thanks Fishtown Analytics for developing dbt. 

In this first video, the focus is on installing dbt on a Windows machine using the CLI. Prerequisites include having Git and Python installed. Installation is done via the command `pip install dbt`. After installation, running `dbt --version` confirms successful setup.

Next, the video guides creating a GitHub repository named "demo-dbt" to store the project files. The repo is cloned locally, and within that directory, the dbt project is initialized using `dbt init demo-dbt`, which creates a skeleton project with example folders (analysis, macros, models, snapshots, tests) and files.

The presenter opens the project in Visual Studio Code to review the structure. The core work happens in the "models" folder. The dbt_project.yml file defines the project name and links to the user profile for database connection.

The profile is configured in the `.dbt` folder, where connection credentials for Snowflake are set, including account info, username, password, role (account admin used here for simplicity), database, warehouse, schema, and concurrency settings. The profile name must match the one referenced in dbt_project.yml.

Using `dbt debug` verifies the connection to Snowflake. Running `dbt run` executes the sample models, creating tables with one row in the Snowflake database, confirming the setup is working.

Finally, the project files are committed and pushed to the GitHub repository. The presenter adjusts the folder structure to avoid unnecessary nesting before pushing the final changes. This setup enables collaborative development with branching and version control.

The video concludes by encouraging viewers to subscribe and engage with comments for future tutorials on dbt.</youtube_summary>

You'll learn how to transform data using dbt (data build tool), covering:

- **dbt Fundamentals**: Understand what dbt is and how it brings software engineering practices to data transformation
- **Project Setup**: Learn how to initialize a dbt project, configure your warehouse connection, and structure your models
- **Models and Materialization**: Create your first dbt models and understand different materialization strategies (view, table, incremental)
- **Testing and Documentation**: Implement data quality tests and auto-generate documentation for your data models
- **Jinja Templating**: Use Jinja for dynamic SQL generation, making your transformations more maintainable and reusable
- **References and Dependencies**: Learn how to reference other models and manage model dependencies
- **Sources and Seeds**: Configure source data connections and manage static reference data
- **Macros and Packages**: Create reusable macros and leverage community packages to extend functionality
- **Incremental Models**: Optimize performance by only processing new or changed data
- **Deployment and Orchestration**: Set up dbt Cloud or integrate with Airflow for production deployment

Here's a minimal dbt model example, `models/staging/stg_customers.sql`:

```sql
with source as (
    select * from {{ source('raw', 'customers') }}
),

renamed as (
    select
        id as customer_id,
        first_name,
        last_name,
        email,
        created_at
    from source
)

select * from renamed
```
