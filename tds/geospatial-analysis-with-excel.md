<youtube_summary>Manhattan, New York City's largest borough, is the battleground for the title of coffee king between Starbucks and McDonald's. Starbucks has been the dominant coffee chain since opening its first store in Manhattan in 1994. Starbucks offers a complex ordering process, while McDonald's entered the coffee market in 2009 with simpler choices and lower prices. Manhattan's 1.5 million residents prioritize proximity when choosing coffee shops. With nearly 230 Starbucks and 16 McDonald's locations, two-thirds of Manhattan's population lives closer to Starbucks, maintaining its lead as coffee king. However, McDonald's shops attract more customers per location, making them more profitable, especially in areas like Washington Heights and East Village. To increase profitability, Starbucks should consider relocating its least profitable store at 383 Madison Avenue near McDonald's most profitable store at 213 Madison Avenue. Similarly, McDonald's could move its least profitable store at 14 East 47th Street near Starbucks' most profitable shop at 125 St. Mark's Place. This strategy may lead to fewer coffee houses in midtown Manhattan and more in Washington Heights and East Village. The ultimate winner of Manhattan's coffee battle remains uncertain, but coffee lovers will benefit for years to come.</youtube_summary>

You'll learn how to create a data-driven story about coffee shop coverage in Manhattan, covering:

- **Data Collection**: Collect and scrape data for coffee shop locations and census population from various sources.
- **Data Processing**: Use Python libraries like geopandas for merging population data with geographic maps.
- **Map Creation**: Generate coverage maps using tools like QGIS and Excel to visualize coffee shop distribution and population impact.
- **Visualization**: Create physical, Power BI, and video visualizations to present the data effectively.
- **Storytelling**: Craft a narrative around coffee shop competition, including strategic insights and potential market changes.
