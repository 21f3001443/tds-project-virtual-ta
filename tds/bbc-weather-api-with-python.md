## BBC Weather location ID with Python

[![BBC Weather location API with Python](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/IafLrvnamAw/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/IafLrvnamAw
<youtube_summary>This tutorial explains how to scrape the location ID from the BBC Weather website, which is essential for retrieving weather data for a specific city. When a city name is typed into the BBC Weather search bar (e.g., Palo Alto), an API call is made that returns a location ID linked to the city's latitude and longitude. This location ID can then be used to fetch detailed weather information.

The tutorial demonstrates how to inspect the website's backend network activity using the browser’s developer tools (Network tab) to observe the API calls triggered by typing a city name. For example, typing "Los Angeles" triggers a location API call returning a JSON response containing the city’s ID, name, country, latitude, longitude, etc. The key information needed is the location ID.

Using Python, the tutorial shows how to scrape this location ID by importing necessary libraries: `requests` to fetch API data, `json` to parse it, and `urlencode` to neatly construct the API URL with query parameters. The API URL consists of a constant prefix (https://bbc.co.uk/location) and key-value pairs including the search string (city name) and other parameters. `urlencode` helps format these parameters into a proper URL.

The Python code sends a GET request to the constructed URL, converts the response into a JSON dictionary, and extracts the location ID from the "results" field. A reusable function is created where you input the city name (converted to lowercase for consistency), and it returns the corresponding location ID. Testing this function with the city "Toronto" successfully returns its location ID (6167865).

This location ID can then be used to retrieve detailed weather data, which will be covered in a subsequent tutorial. The main focus here is on extracting the location ID via the API call, enabling further weather data scraping.</youtube_summary>

<youtube_summary>This video tutorial explains how to work with JSON data in Python, covering both string and file handling, and demonstrating real-world API usage.

Key points covered include:

1. **Introduction to JSON**: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular, language-independent data format used for storing and exchanging information, commonly used in APIs and configuration files.

2. **Loading JSON strings into Python**:
   - Import Python's built-in `json` module (no installation required).
   - Use `json.loads()` to parse a JSON-formatted string into Python objects.
   - JSON objects convert to Python dictionaries, arrays to lists, strings to strings, numbers to int/float, `true`/`false` to `True`/`False`, and `null` to `None`.
   - Once loaded, JSON data can be accessed and manipulated like standard Python dictionaries and lists.

3. **Dumping Python objects to JSON strings**:
   - Use `json.dumps()` to convert Python objects back to JSON strings.
   - You can format the JSON output using the `indent` parameter for readability.
   - The `sort_keys=True` option sorts dictionary keys alphabetically in the output.

4. **Working with JSON files**:
   - Use `json.load()` to read JSON data directly from a file.
   - Use `json.dump()` to write Python objects to a JSON file.
   - Files can be opened using Python’s `with open()` syntax to ensure proper handling.
   - Formatting can also be applied to file outputs using the `indent` parameter.

5. **Practical example with a public API**:
   - Demonstrates fetching JSON data from a Yahoo Finance API that provides currency conversion rates.
   - Uses Python’s `urllib.request.urlopen` to fetch data from the web.
   - Reads the response, parses it with `json.loads()`, and pretty-prints it with indentation.
   - Shows how to navigate nested JSON data structures to extract specific fields like conversion names and prices.
   - Illustrates creating a Python dictionary mapping currency names to conversion rates.
   - Demonstrates performing currency conversions using these rates.

6. **Additional tips**:
   - Explains the difference between `json.load()` (for files) and `json.loads()` (for strings).
   - Suggests saving API data locally for faster repeated access.
   - Encourages building reusable functions to access and use JSON data.

- Learn about the [`BeautifulSoup` package](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/). Watch [Python Tutorial: Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup and Requests](https://youtu.be/ng2o98k983k
<youtube_summary>This video tutorial explains how to scrape websites using the BeautifulSoup library in Python, along with the requests library for fetching web content. Web scraping involves parsing website content to extract specific information, such as headlines, summaries, or links.

The tutorial begins with an example of scraping a personal website's homepage to extract video post titles, summaries, and links. The scraper prints this information and also saves it to a CSV file. The instructor emphasizes using BeautifulSoup 4 and recommends installing the lxml parser for HTML parsing, explaining that different parsers handle imperfect HTML differently.

An introduction to HTML structure is provided, showing how tags like <div>, <h2>, <a>, and <p> are nested and how to locate specific content within these tags. The tutorial demonstrates how to open and parse a local HTML file using BeautifulSoup, print and prettify the parsed HTML, and extract tag text and attributes.

Using methods like `find` and `find_all`, the instructor shows how to locate tags with specific attributes (e.g., a div with class "article") and extract nested content such as headlines and summaries. The tutorial progresses to scraping a live website using requests to get the HTML, then parsing it with BeautifulSoup.

Detailed inspection of the website's HTML structure is done via the browser's developer tools to identify the tags containing the desired content, such as article headlines, summaries, and embedded YouTube videos. The tutorial explains extracting the video ID from the iframe’s src URL by splitting the string and rebuilding a direct YouTube link.

The scraper is enhanced to loop through all articles on the page to extract all headlines, summaries, and video links, printing them out. The instructor also addresses the issue of missing data (e.g., posts without videos) causing errors by wrapping the extraction code in a try-except block to handle exceptions gracefully and assign None to missing data.

Finally, the tutorial covers saving the scraped data to a CSV file using Python's csv module, including writing headers and rows for each article. The CSV file can be opened in spreadsheet applications like Excel or Numbers for easy viewing.

The video concludes with advice to check for public APIs on large websites (like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube) as these provide more efficient and respectful data access, and to be considerate when scraping to avoid overwhelming servers.

The next video will delve deeper into pandas DataFrames and the Series data type, teaching how to select and manipulate data more effectively.</youtube_summary>
)
  - [Python Pandas Tutorial (Part 2): DataFrame and Series Basics - Selecting Rows and Columns](https://youtu.be/zmdjNSmRXF4
<youtube_summary>This video tutorial continues teaching about pandas, focusing on the two primary data types: DataFrame and Series, which are fundamental for data manipulation in pandas. The instructor revisits DataFrames, explaining them as tables composed of rows and columns, demonstrated using survey data loaded from CSV files. A DataFrame displays data in a tabular format, with each row representing an individual record (e.g., a survey respondent) and each column representing a variable or question.

To help conceptualize DataFrames, the instructor compares them to native Python dictionaries with keys as columns and lists as values representing rows. For multiple records, dictionary values are lists of data. This analogy aids understanding but pandas DataFrames offer much more functionality. A DataFrame can be created from such a dictionary using pandas, yielding a structured table with an index on the left.

The tutorial then explains accessing data within DataFrames. Single columns can be accessed like dictionary keys using bracket notation (e.g., df['email']) or dot notation (e.g., df.email). The instructor prefers bracket notation to avoid conflicts with DataFrame methods named like column names. Accessing a single column returns a pandas Series, a one-dimensional labeled array. A DataFrame contains multiple Series objects, one per column.

Multiple columns can be accessed by passing a list of column names inside brackets (e.g., df[['last', 'email']]), returning a DataFrame subset. To access rows, pandas provides .iloc (integer-location based) and .loc (label-based) indexers. For instance, df.iloc[0] returns the first row by position as a Series, while df.loc[0] returns the row by label (default index is integer labels starting at 0). Both .iloc and .loc support slicing and selecting multiple rows and columns by passing lists or slices. With .iloc, columns are specified by integer positions; with .loc, columns are specified by labels.

The instructor demonstrates these concepts using a small example dataset and then applies them to a larger Stack Overflow survey dataset with about 88,000 rows and 85 columns. They show how to retrieve a specific column (like 'Hobbyist'), view its value counts to see how many respondents answered yes or no, and select specific rows and columns using .loc with slicing and lists.

The video emphasizes that DataFrames and Series have extensive functionality beyond native Python structures, simplifying complex data analysis tasks. The instructor previews future lessons on indexes, advanced filtering, querying, and data type inspection.

Additionally, the video is sponsored by Brilliant.org, a platform offering interactive courses in data science and Python, recommended as a supplementary learning resource.

In summary, this tutorial introduces pandas DataFrame and Series, explains how to think about and access data within them, demonstrates basic operations on small and large datasets, and sets the stage for more advanced pandas topics in upcoming videos.</youtube_summary>

- Learn about the [`re` package](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html). Watch [Python Tutorial: re Module - How to Write and Match Regular Expressions (Regex)](https://youtu.be/K8L6KVGG-7o
<youtube_summary>This video tutorial explains how to work with regular expressions (regex) in Python using the built-in `re` module. It builds on a previous general regex video by focusing on Python-specific usage and examples.

Key points covered include:

1. **Introduction to Regex and Raw Strings**:  
   - Regex allows searching and matching text patterns.  
   - Python raw strings (prefixed with `r`) prevent escape characters like backslashes from being processed, which is important for regex patterns.

2. **Using the `re` Module**:  
   - Import `re` to use regex in Python.  
   - Use `re.compile()` to compile regex patterns into reusable variables.  
   - Use methods like `finditer` to find all matches as iterator objects, which provide match details such as span (start and end indices).

3. **Literal vs Meta Characters**:  
   - Literal characters match exactly as typed.  
   - Meta characters like `.` (dot) match any character except newline.  
   - Special characters must be escaped with a backslash to be matched literally (e.g., `\.` for a period).  
   - Character sets (`[ ]`) match any one character inside them, including ranges (e.g., `[a-z]` for lowercase letters).  
   - Negated sets (`[^ ]`) match any character not in the set.  
   - Anchors like `\b` (word boundary), `^` (start of string), and `$` (end of string) match positions rather than characters.

4. **Common Regex Classes and Their Negations**:  
   - `\d`: digit (0-9), `\D`: non-digit.  
   - `\w`: word character (letters, digits, underscore), `\W`: non-word character.  
   - `\s`: whitespace (space, tab, newline), `\S`: non-whitespace.

5. **Quantifiers**:  
   - `*`: zero or more matches.  
   - `+`: one or more matches.  
   - `?`: zero or one match (makes preceding character optional).  
   - `{n}`: exactly n matches.  
   - `{n,m}`: between n and m matches.

6. **Groups and Alternation**:  
   - Parentheses `()` create groups to capture parts of matches or specify alternatives with `|` (or operator).  
   - Example: to match prefixes like "Mr", "Miss", or "Mrs", use groups with alternation.

7. **Practical Examples**:  
   - Matching phone numbers with different separators (dash or dot).  
   - Matching names with optional prefixes and periods.  
   - Matching email addresses by building regex with character sets, quantifiers, groups, and alternation.  
   - Matching URLs with optional "https" and "www" parts, capturing domain and top-level domain with groups.

8. **Using Captured Groups**:  
   - Access groups in match objects via `.group(index)`.  
   - Group 0 is the entire match; other groups correspond to parenthesized parts.  
   - Use backreferences (`\1`, `\2`, etc.) in substitutions.  
   - Use `re.sub()` to replace matched patterns with captured groups for text transformation.

9. **Other Useful `re` Methods**:  
   - `findall()`: returns list of matched strings or groups (simpler than `finditer`).  
   - `match()`: checks if pattern matches at the start of the string only.  
   - `search()`: searches entire string and returns first match.

10. **Flags**:  
    - Flags modify regex behavior, such as `re.IGNORECASE` or `re.I` for case-insensitive matching.  
    - Other flags include multiline matching and verbose mode for readable patterns.

The video concludes by encouraging practice with regex, noting advanced features and flags will be covered in future tutorials, and invites questions and support from viewers. It emphasizes regex’s power for parsing, searching, and transforming text efficiently within Python programs.</youtube_summary>

- Learn about the [`datetime` package](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html). Watch [Python Tutorial: Datetime Module - How to work with Dates, Times, Timedeltas, and Timezones](https://youtu.be/eirjjyP2qcQ
<youtube_summary>This video tutorial covers working with dates and times in Python using the built-in datetime module and the third-party pytz library.

Key points include:

1. Importance of Dates in Python:
   - Dates and times are essential in many applications.
   - Concepts covered include dates, times, datetimes, time zones, and timedeltas.

2. Naive vs. Aware DateTimes:
   - Naive datetimes lack time zone and daylight savings info and are simpler to use.
   - Aware datetimes include time zone and daylight savings info to avoid confusion.

3. Working with Dates:
   - Use `datetime.date(year, month, day)` to create dates (month/day as integers without leading zeros).
   - Get current local date with `date.today()`.
   - Access year, month, day attributes.
   - Get day of the week via `weekday()` (Monday=0) or `isoweekday()` (Monday=1).

4. TimeDelta:
   - Represents a duration (difference) between two dates or times.
   - Create with `timedelta(days=7)`.
   - Add/subtract timedeltas to/from dates to get new dates.
   - Subtracting two dates returns a timedelta.
   - Timedelta supports days, hours, minutes, seconds, etc.

5. Working with Times:
   - `datetime.time` holds hours, minutes, seconds, microseconds without date.
   - Usually combined with date in `datetime.datetime`.

6. Working with DateTime:
   - `datetime.datetime(year, month, day, hour, minute, second, microsecond)` gives full date and time.
   - Access date and time separately via `.date()` and `.time()`.
   - Supports adding/subtracting timedelta.

7. Alternative Constructors:
   - `datetime.today()` returns current local naive datetime.
   - `datetime.now()` returns current local datetime with optional timezone.
   - `datetime.utcnow()` returns current UTC naive datetime.

8. Time Zones with pytz:
   - Python standard library has limited timezone support; pytz is recommended.
   - Install pytz via `pip install pytz`.
   - Create aware datetime by passing `tzinfo=pytz.UTC` or other time zones.
   - Get current aware UTC time with `datetime.now(pytz.UTC)`.
   - Convert between time zones using `.astimezone()`.
   - Localize naive datetimes using `timezone.localize(naive_datetime)` before conversion.
   - pytz includes a comprehensive list of time zones accessible via `pytz.all_timezones`.

9. Formatting DateTimes:
   - Use `.isoformat()` to get ISO standard string representation.
   - Use `.strftime(format_string)` to format dates/times in custom formats (e.g., "%B %d, %Y" for "July 26, 2016").
   - Convert strings back to datetime objects with `datetime.strptime(date_string, format_string)`.

10. Additional Notes:
    - The tutorial suggests considering the Arrow library for easier datetime handling.
    - Encourages viewers to ask questions, like, share, and subscribe.

Overall, the video provides a comprehensive introduction to handling dates, times, timedeltas, time zones, formatting, and parsing in Python using datetime and pytz.</youtube_summary>
