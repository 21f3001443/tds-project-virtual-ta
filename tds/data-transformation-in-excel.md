<youtube_summary>In this session, we continue exploring Excel functions for data cleaning by focusing on calculating ratios and using pivot tables to analyze data and identify outliers.

First, using a previously used dataset, we calculate specific ratios:  
- Metro area to city area ratio (metro area in column G divided by city area in column D). For example, Tokyo's metro area is about six times its city area.  
- Metro population to city population ratio (metro population in column F divided by city population in column C), with Tokyo's ratio being 2.76.  
- Density comparison between metro and city areas is also computed to understand crowding.

Next, we create a pivot table to aggregate and analyze data:  
- Selecting the entire dataset, we insert a pivot table in a new worksheet.  
- By dragging the country field into rows, we get unique country entries and can filter (e.g., China has 20 city entries).  
- Adding the country to values shows the count of occurrences, helping identify duplicates (e.g., Angola appears once, China 20 times).  
- Including the city column provides detailed city-level data per country.  
- Adding city proper population as values and setting aggregation to sum shows population totals at city and country levels.

We then create charts from the pivot table data:  
- A bar chart visualizes population distribution for selected countries, such as China, highlighting highly populated cities like Chongqing and Shanghai as outliers.  
- Using calculated ratios like density, filtered by country (e.g., US), shows cities like Los Angeles with the highest crowding.

Overall, Excel's ratio calculations combined with pivot tables and charts allow efficient aggregation, outlier identification, and meaningful insights from data, aiding in data cleaning and analysis.</youtube_summary>

You'll learn data transformation techniques in Excel, covering:

- **Calculating Ratios**: Compute metro area to city area and metro population to city population ratios.
- **Using Pivot Tables**: Create pivot tables to aggregate data and identify outliers.
- **Filtering Data**: Apply filters in pivot tables to analyze specific subsets of data.
- **Counting Data Occurrences**: Use pivot tables to count the frequency of specific entries.
- **Creating Charts**: Generate charts from pivot table data to visualize distributions and outliers.
