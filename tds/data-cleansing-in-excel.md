<youtube_summary>In today's session, we demonstrated how to prepare and clean data using Microsoft Excel with a city-wise population dataset downloaded from Wikipedia. The dataset includes various columns such as city name, country, population estimates, city type, and population area, containing different data types like text and numbers.

Key cleaning techniques covered:

1. **Find and Replace:** Using the shortcut Ctrl+H, we removed the term "more" (within square brackets) appended to country names in column B by replacing it with nothing, resulting in cleaner country names.

2. **Changing Data Format:** Columns E to N containing numeric data were changed from the general format to number format with two decimal places through the format tab.

3. **Removing Extra Spaces:** Extra spaces within text, especially in column D (city names), were eliminated using Excel’s TRIM function. A new column was created where the TRIM function was applied to remove unnecessary spaces around text.

4. **Identifying and Deleting Blank Cells:** Blank cells in column D were identified using "Find and Select" > "Go To Special" > "Blanks." Highlighted rows with blank cells were then deleted entirely to clean the dataset.

5. **Removing Duplicates:** A copy of the Country column was made on a new sheet. Using the Data tab’s "Remove Duplicates" function, 44 duplicate entries were removed from 77 values, leaving 35 unique country names.

These basic Excel functionalities effectively clean data when the dataset is small and provide users with good control over data preparation and cleaning processes.</youtube_summary>
