<youtube_summary>This text introduces Open Refine, a free, open-source data cleaning tool originally developed by Google, used for resolving inconsistencies in data entries. The instructor explains that Open Refine helps address real-world problems such as differing representations of the same entity—for example, a bank named "XYZ Limited" versus "XYZ Ltd"—which computers treat as separate entries despite being the same. The tool is demonstrated using a dataset from the US Department of Justice containing case IDs, trade names, legal names, and addresses. The instructor shows how minor differences in addresses, like extra commas or dots, cause entries to be treated separately. Using Open Refine's features, such as Facet and Text Facet, users can view frequency of address entries. Then, using the clustering method, similar entries are grouped and can be merged either manually or automatically, effectively cleaning the data by consolidating different versions of the same entity. This process exemplifies entity resolution, which is the main function of Open Refine showcased in this exercise.</youtube_summary>

This session covers the use of OpenRefine for data cleaning, focusing on resolving entity discrepancies:

- **Data Upload and Project Creation**: Import data into OpenRefine and create a new project for analysis.
- **Faceting Data**: Use text facets to group similar entries and identify frequency of address crumbs.
- **Clustering Methodology**: Apply clustering algorithms to merge similar entries with minor differences, such as punctuation.
- **Manual and Automated Clustering**: Learn to merge clusters manually or in one go, trusting the system's clustering accuracy.
- **Entity Resolution**: Clean and save the data by resolving multiple versions of the same entity using Open Refine.
