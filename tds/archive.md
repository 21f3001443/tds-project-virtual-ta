## Optional: Parse & clean PDF files with Tabula

[![Parse & clean PDF files with Tabula](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/IEusn9HB1sc/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/IEusn9HB1sc
<youtube_summary>This video explains how data journalists can extract data from PDFs, which are often difficult to convert into usable formats like CSV or Excel. It uses a one-page PDF report on the state of the wall in South Africa as an example, highlighting the challenges of copying tables directly from PDFs. The video introduces Tabula, an open-source tool available for Windows, Mac OS, and via GitHub, which runs inside a browser and helps extract tables from PDFs effectively. 

To use Tabula, you open the PDF file through the "browse" option and import it into the application. Tabula displays thumbnails of each page and allows you to auto-detect tables or manually select specific tables to avoid unwanted data. After selecting the desired table by clicking and dragging, you can preview the extraction to ensure accuracy. Once satisfied, export the data as a CSV file, which can be opened in spreadsheet programs like LibreOffice, Microsoft Excel, or Google Sheets for further analysis such as sorting or chart creation.

The video notes that while this example involves a simple, single-page PDF, Tabula can also handle more complex tasks like extracting tables spanning multiple pages, which will be covered in a subsequent video. Overall, Tabula is presented as one of the easiest and most reliable tools for extracting tabular data from PDFs in data journalism.</youtube_summary>

<youtube_summary>In this Python 3 series episode, Anthony explains IO in Python, focusing on differences between binary and text IO and their behavior in Python 2 and 3, with code snippets for compatibility.

Key points:

1. Files on disk store data as bytes; text is represented as code points encoded into bytes (e.g., UTF-8 encoding).
2. Binary IO deals directly with bytes (bytes and bytearray types), writing them unmodified to disk.
3. Text IO involves encoding Unicode text (unicode in Python 2, str in Python 3) into bytes before writing.
4. Python 2:
   - open() always opens files in binary mode; 'wb' or 'rb' are redundant but clarify intent.
   - Implicit ASCII conversion can cause errors with non-ASCII text.
   - Standard output and error streams have encoding set only when attached to a terminal, detected via environment variables (e.g., LANG). Without proper environment settings or TTY, writing non-ASCII text reliably requires writing encoded bytes directly.
   - In-memory IO classes: cStringIO (binary, fast) and StringIO (mixed text/binary but slower, pure Python).
5. Python 3:
   - open() behaves like io.open(), returning either binary or text IO objects depending on mode ('b' for binary).
   - No implicit conversion between text and bytes; attempting to mix causes errors.
   - Encoding can be specified; otherwise, locale-based preferred encoding is used.
   - Standard output and error are text IO wrappers with an underlying binary buffer accessible via the buffer attribute.
   - IO is buffered by default; to ensure immediate output, flush() or flush=True should be used.
   - In-memory IO uses io.BytesIO for binary and io.StringIO for text.
6. Writing code compatible with Python 2 and 3:
   - Use io.open instead of open.
   - Replace cStringIO/StringIO with io.BytesIO/io.StringIO.
   - For binary writing to standard IO, conditionally access the buffer attribute.
   - For text writing in constrained environments, use codecs.getwriter with a forced encoding like UTF-8.

The episode clarifies the distinction between binary and text IO, highlights differences in Python 2 and 3 behavior, and provides practical advice for cross-version compatibility.</youtube_summary>

[![Wikipedia data with Wikimedia Python library](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/b6puvm-QEY0/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/b6puvm-QEY0
<youtube_summary>This tutorial explains how to use the Wikipedia library in Python to access and extract information from Wikipedia pages easily. First, install the library using pip and import it. You can search Wikipedia pages by keywords using the search function, which returns all pages containing the keyword. To get only the top important results, use the 'result' argument with the desired number of results.

To obtain a summary of a page, use the summary function; you can specify the number of sentences for a shorter summary. For the full Wikipedia page with sections and references, use the page function. The page object also allows you to retrieve the page URL, reference links, title images (as a list of image links), and tables from the article.

For tables, the content is stored as a list, and you can extract specific tables as HTML and then use pandas to read and process them. Note that the first table might be a table of contents, usually not needed.

Overall, this library simplifies scraping Wikipedia data compared to traditional methods like using requests and BeautifulSoup. It provides straightforward functions to search, summarize, access full pages, references, images, and tables efficiently.</youtube_summary>

## Image labelling with chess pieces

[![Image labelling with chess pieces](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/OTRamjRb7P4/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/OTRamjRb7P4
<youtube_summary>This session focuses on preparing a dataset for an image classification problem, exemplified by classifying images as cats or dogs. If no dataset is provided, images can be manually downloaded from Google, but this can be automated using the Python library BeautifulSoup. By specifying search parameters and browser settings (e.g., using Chrome), BeautifulSoup can scrape and download images (filtered by JPEG format) directly to a local or cloud environment.

For example, searching "IITM" downloads related images, which can be changed to other terms like "chess pawn" to download relevant images automatically. Once images for different classes (e.g., chess pieces like bishop, king) are downloaded into separate folders, their file paths need to be recorded for model input. This can be automated via the command prompt by navigating to the image folder and running a command (`dir /s /b > list.csv`) to generate a CSV file listing all image paths.

To assign target classes, the class names can be appended in the CSV file. For quality control, images can be previewed individually using Windows preview or within Excel using macros. The session demonstrates how to create an Excel macro with an Image ActiveX Control that dynamically displays the selected image from the list. The macro listens for selection changes, fetches the image path from the sheet, and loads the image into the control for preview, enabling quick verification of image clarity and correctness.

In summary, the process includes:
1. Using BeautifulSoup to automate image downloads from Google by passing search parameters.
2. Organizing images into class-specific folders.
3. Using command prompt commands to generate CSV files listing image paths.
4. Creating target classes by editing the CSV.
5. Employing Excel macros with ActiveX Image controls to preview images for data cleaning.

This workflow streamlines dataset preparation for image classification tasks by automating image collection, organizing data, and facilitating quality checks.</youtube_summary>

<youtube_summary>This video tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to the Python Imaging Library, known as PIL or Pillow, which is used for image processing in Python. The key points covered include:

1. **Introduction to Pillow**: Pillow allows manipulation and processing of images, enabling changes and various image operations.

2. **Setup and Imports**: Importing essential modules such as `Image` from Pillow, `matplotlib` for displaying images within Jupyter notebooks, and `numpy`.

3. **Creating and Displaying Images**: Using `Image.open()` to create image objects and displaying images both via default OS viewers and within Jupyter using matplotlib.

4. **Image Properties**: Accessing image size (width × height), format (e.g., JPEG), and mode (e.g., RGB, HSV).

5. **Saving Images**: Saving edited images with `image.save()`.

6. **Cropping Images**: Cropping via specifying two diagonal points (left-top and right-bottom) to define the crop rectangle.

7. **Copying Images**: Making copies of images to preserve originals while applying transformations.

8. **Transposing and Rotating**: Changing image orientation through flipping left-right, top-bottom, rotating by 90°, 180°, 270°, or transposing (swapping rows and columns).

9. **Resizing Images**: Changing image dimensions using tuples (width, height) and different interpolation algorithms (nearest, box, bilinear, hamming, bicubic, and lanczos) affecting image quality.

10. **Rotation by Angle**: Rotating images by arbitrary angles using `image.rotate()`.

11. **Adding Text Watermarks**: Creating editable images with `ImageDraw.Draw()`, selecting fonts with `ImageFont.truetype()`, and adding text at specified positions with customizable color.

12. **Adding Image Watermarks**: Creating thumbnails that preserve aspect ratio, then pasting these smaller images onto base images at specified coordinates.

13. **Color Mode Conversion**: Converting images to black and white (`L` mode), HSV, and other color modes useful for computer vision and deep learning.

14. **Converting Between PIL Images and NumPy Arrays**: Using `np.array()` to convert images to arrays and `Image.fromarray()` to convert arrays back to images, noting differences in dimension ordering.

15. **Image Enhancement**: Enhancing color, contrast, brightness, and sharpness via `ImageEnhance` with adjustable factors (>1 to enhance, <1 to reduce).

16. **Alpha Blending**: Combining two images with transparency by blending them based on an alpha value between 0 and 1, requiring images to be the same size and have alpha channels.

17. **Image Transforms**: Applying affine transforms (changing perspective with a 6-value matrix) and extent transforms (cropping and zooming a section), though math details are briefly touched upon.

18. **Flipping Color Channels**: Splitting an image into RGB channels and merging them back in different orders (e.g., BGR) to suit frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

The tutorial emphasizes practical coding examples and visual demonstrations for each operation, aiming to equip viewers with a solid understanding of Pillow's capabilities for image manipulation in Python.</youtube_summary>

- Learn about the [BeautifulSoup module](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#quick-start) and [video](https://youtu.be/XVv6mJpFOb0
<youtube_summary>This special Python tutorial, presented as a guest on the freeCodeCamp channel and also available on the creator's own channel "Gymshape Coding," covers web scraping using the Beautiful Soup library. The tutorial begins with scraping a basic HTML page to explain essential concepts, then moves on to scraping real websites and storing the extracted data.

Initially, the tutorial explains the structure of an example HTML page containing course information, highlighting tags like html, head, body, div with class attributes, h1, h5, p, and a tags, and how these define the page layout and content. The importance of understanding HTML tags and attributes, especially class names, for web scraping is emphasized.

The tutorial then guides on installing necessary Python libraries: Beautiful Soup 4 (`bs4`) and `lxml` parser for robust HTML parsing. It shows how to open and read an HTML file in Python and create a Beautiful Soup object to parse and prettify the HTML content. Methods like `find` (returns the first matching tag) and `find_all` (returns all matching tags as a list) are demonstrated, using examples of extracting all `h5` tags (course titles).

Next, the tutorial explains how to filter tags by attributes such as class, showing how to retrieve course cards (`div` tags with class "card") and extract nested elements like course names (`h5` tags) and prices (`a` tags), including extracting and formatting text content. It also covers splitting strings to isolate price values and formatting output with f-strings.

For scraping real websites, the tutorial introduces the `requests` library to fetch live HTML content from URLs. Using "timejobs.com" as an example, it demonstrates searching for job listings related to Python programming. Inspecting the browser's developer tools is shown as a method to identify relevant HTML elements and class names to target.

The tutorial illustrates how to extract multiple job posts by selecting `li` tags with specific class names, and then how to extract company names, required skills (`span` tags), posted dates, and job links (`a` tags inside header elements). Techniques for cleaning extracted text, such as using `.replace()` to remove unwanted whitespace and `.strip()`, are included.

It explains filtering job posts based on criteria such as only including those posted "a few days ago" and excluding jobs requiring "unfamiliar skills" entered by the user via input. A challenge is posed to extend filtering to multiple skills.

The tutorial advances by wrapping scraping logic inside a function and using a `while True` loop with `time.sleep()` to run the scraper periodically (e.g., every 10 minutes). It shows how to save each job post's information into individual text files inside a dedicated directory, naming files by index and formatting content with newline characters for readability.

Overall, this tutorial provides a thorough introduction to web scraping with Python, covering HTML basics, using Beautiful Soup for parsing and extraction, handling live web requests, filtering and formatting data, automating scraping tasks, and saving results to files. The creator encourages viewers to explore the provided code and links for deeper learning and customization.</youtube_summary>

- Learn about the [io module](https://pymotw.com/3/io/), [reference](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html) and [video](https://youtu.be/cIaOisyd7lE
<youtube_summary>In this Python 3 series episode, Anthony explains IO in Python, focusing on differences between binary and text IO and their behavior in Python 2 and 3, with code snippets for compatibility.

Key points:

1. Files on disk store data as bytes; text is represented as code points encoded into bytes (e.g., UTF-8 encoding).
2. Binary IO deals directly with bytes (bytes and bytearray types), writing them unmodified to disk.
3. Text IO involves encoding Unicode text (unicode in Python 2, str in Python 3) into bytes before writing.
4. Python 2:
   - open() always opens files in binary mode; 'wb' or 'rb' are redundant but clarify intent.
   - Implicit ASCII conversion can cause errors with non-ASCII text.
   - Standard output and error streams have encoding set only when attached to a terminal, detected via environment variables (e.g., LANG). Without proper environment settings or TTY, writing non-ASCII text reliably requires writing encoded bytes directly.
   - In-memory IO classes: cStringIO (binary, fast) and StringIO (mixed text/binary but slower, pure Python).
5. Python 3:
   - open() behaves like io.open(), returning either binary or text IO objects depending on mode ('b' for binary).
   - No implicit conversion between text and bytes; attempting to mix causes errors.
   - Encoding can be specified; otherwise, locale-based preferred encoding is used.
   - Standard output and error are text IO wrappers with an underlying binary buffer accessible via the buffer attribute.
   - IO is buffered by default; to ensure immediate output, flush() or flush=True should be used.
   - In-memory IO uses io.BytesIO for binary and io.StringIO for text.
6. Writing code compatible with Python 2 and 3:
   - Use io.open instead of open.
   - Replace cStringIO/StringIO with io.BytesIO/io.StringIO.
   - For binary writing to standard IO, conditionally access the buffer attribute.
   - For text writing in constrained environments, use codecs.getwriter with a forced encoding like UTF-8.

The episode clarifies the distinction between binary and text IO, highlights differences in Python 2 and 3 behavior, and provides practical advice for cross-version compatibility.</youtube_summary>

<youtube_summary>This tutorial focuses on forecasting COVID-19 data, specifically daily new deaths, using Python. The presenter uses open-source COVID-19 data containing multiple parameters but concentrates on new deaths for simplicity. The data spans from January to July 2021 for countries like India, Israel, and Japan, with the initial focus on India.

Several forecasting techniques are demonstrated:

1. **Moving Averages:**  
   - The tutorial explains rolling/moving averages (e.g., 5-day, 10-day) as a basic forecasting method, where the average of past days predicts the current value.  
   - Visualization shows that shorter windows (like 5-day) closely follow actual data, while longer windows deviate more.  
   - Missing values (NAs) appear for initial days where past data is insufficient and are dropped.

2. **Autocorrelation Plot:**  
   - Used to identify significant time lags in the data.  
   - The plot shows strong correlation for short lags (1 to 5 days) and weak or negative correlation for longer lags (beyond 40 days), indicating that recent days are more predictive.

3. **ARIMA Model:**  
   - Introduced as a more advanced forecasting technique involving autoregressive and moving average components.  
   - The presenter explains choosing lag parameters based on autocorrelation significance (lags 1 and 2 are significant).  
   - The data is split into 90% training and 10% testing based on time order.  
   - The ARIMA model with 1 or 5 lags is trained and used to forecast future deaths.

4. **Performance Comparison:**  
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is used to evaluate forecasting accuracy.  
   - Results show the 5-day moving average achieves the lowest MAE (~110), outperforming ARIMA (~133). Longer moving average windows perform worse.  
   - Both methods provide reasonable predictions, with moving average being simpler and slightly better in this case.

The tutorial concludes by encouraging extension of these forecasting techniques to other datasets and domains, emphasizing the value of historical data in predicting future trends.</youtube_summary>

<youtube_summary>This video tutorial provides a comprehensive introduction to the Python pandas library, emphasizing its usefulness for data science tasks compared to Excel, particularly due to its flexibility and ability to handle large datasets. The tutorial begins by guiding viewers to install pandas via pip and download a Pokémon dataset from the creator’s GitHub, which is used throughout the video for demonstrations.

Key topics covered include:

1. **Loading Data:** Instructions on importing pandas, loading CSV, Excel, and tab-separated files into pandas DataFrames, and viewing data using functions like `.head()` and `.tail()`.

2. **Exploring Data:** How to inspect DataFrame columns, select single or multiple columns, and access rows using `.iloc` and `.loc`. Iterating through rows with `.iterrows()` is also shown.

3. **Filtering Data:** Using `.loc[]` with conditions (including multiple conditions using `&` for AND and `|` for OR), string containment with `.str.contains()`, and regular expressions for advanced text filtering. Case-insensitive filtering using regex flags is demonstrated.

4. **Modifying Data:** Adding new columns by summing existing columns, dropping columns, reordering columns, and safely handling data manipulation to avoid errors. Examples include creating a "total" stats column for Pokémon.

5. **Saving Data:** Exporting DataFrames to CSV, Excel, and tab-separated text files with options to exclude the index column.

6. **Advanced Filtering and Conditional Updates:** Changing column values based on conditions, modifying multiple columns simultaneously, and resetting the DataFrame to a checkpoint by reloading the CSV.

7. **Grouping and Aggregation:** Using `.groupby()` to compute aggregate statistics like mean, sum, and count grouped by columns (e.g., Pokémon type), sorting grouped results, and understanding use cases for aggregation.

8. **Handling Large Datasets:** Reading large CSV files in chunks to manage memory efficiently, processing each chunk with groupby operations, and concatenating results to build a summary DataFrame.

Throughout, the instructor emphasizes best practices such as verifying calculations, avoiding hard-coded indices when possible, and consulting pandas documentation. The video is designed both for beginners starting from scratch and intermediate users seeking specific pandas techniques. The creator encourages viewers to subscribe for future tutorials covering plotting and more advanced pandas and Python features and invites questions and suggestions in the comments.

Overall, the tutorial equips viewers with foundational and some advanced pandas skills for effective data manipulation, filtering, aggregation, and handling large datasets using Python.</youtube_summary>

- Learn about the [matplotlib module](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/quick_start.html) and [video](https://youtu.be/3Xc3CA655Y4
<youtube_summary>This video tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to using the matplotlib library in Python for data visualization, starting with line graphs and progressing to more complex plots using real-world data and the pandas library.

The tutorial begins with matplotlib basics, demonstrating how to create line graphs, format lines, add titles, axis labels, tick marks, legends, and customize fonts and colors. It explains how to plot multiple lines, use numpy arrays for data points, and customize lines with colors, markers, line styles, and shorthand notation. The video also covers resizing graphs and saving figures with specified DPI for high-resolution images.

Next, it introduces bar charts, showing how to create bars with labels and values, customize bar patterns using hatch styles, and add legends. The tutorial emphasizes using the matplotlib documentation and Google searches for troubleshooting and customization.

The instructor then moves to real-world examples combining pandas and matplotlib. Using CSV datasets from the presenter's GitHub (gas prices over time by country and FIFA video game player stats), the video demonstrates how to load data with pandas, plot multiple lines for countries’ gas prices over years, customize tick marks, labels, legends, and fonts, and automate plotting for multiple countries.

For the FIFA dataset, the tutorial covers creating histograms for player skill distributions, pie charts for preferred foot and weight distribution (after data cleaning and categorization), and box-and-whisker plots to compare overall player ratings across different soccer clubs. It shows how to filter pandas DataFrames, convert string data to numeric, set plot styles, adjust labels, add titles, and customize plot appearance (colors, line widths, median lines).

Throughout, the video stresses the usefulness of matplotlib’s documentation and online resources, encourages experimenting with plot styles and parameters, and offers tips for improving plot readability and aesthetics.

The tutorial concludes by inviting viewers to suggest additional graph types for future videos, encouraging subscription and social media follows for more content, and emphasizing the value of combining pandas data manipulation with matplotlib visualization for insightful data analysis.</youtube_summary>

- Learn about the [statsmodels module](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) and [video](https://youtu.be/2BdfjqyWj3c
<youtube_summary>In this session of "Data Science for Everyone," the focus is on introducing the statsmodels Python package, which offers classes and functions for estimating various statistical models, conducting tests, and performing data exploration. Statsmodels supports R-style formulas and integrates well with pandas DataFrames, making it accessible for those familiar with R. 

The presenter demonstrates how to import necessary libraries (numpy, pandas, statsmodels.api as sm, and statsmodels.formula.api as smf), and how to load datasets from statsmodels' built-in R dataset collection. Using the 'histdat' dataset, they showcase loading data into a pandas DataFrame and inspecting it.

A basic example of fitting an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model using a formula interface is provided, where the dependent variable is 'lottery' and independent variables include 'literacy' and the natural log of 'pop'. The resulting summary output is shown, highlighting key statistics such as p-values, coefficients, and model fit measures. The presenter notes the clean HTML-style output in Jupyter notebooks.

Another example uses numpy arrays directly, generating synthetic data with known coefficients and adding random error, then fitting an OLS model without using formulas. This illustrates flexibility in statsmodels for different data input methods.

Additionally, the presenter explains how to explore the results object by using Python's dir() function to access various statistics (e.g., R-squared, F-statistic, AIC, BIC, skewness, kurtosis), which can be useful for generating automated reports, possibly with templating tools like Jinja2.

The session concludes by summarizing that statsmodels provides tools for statistical modeling, hypothesis testing, and data exploration, inviting viewers to comment, subscribe, and like for more content. Further videos will delve deeper into datasets, statistical concepts, and report generation.</youtube_summary>

## Data classification with Python

[![Data classification with Python](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/XsOihX38Bg0/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/XsOihX38Bg0
<youtube_summary>The session focuses on using a decision tree classifier to solve a binary classification problem: predicting whether to approve a credit card application based on historical applicant and credit history data. The dataset includes an application dataset with binary, continuous, and categorical variables, and a credit history dataset containing monthly status records per customer.

Key steps and details include:

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Credit history data with multiple entries per customer are aggregated by selecting the maximum month balance per customer.
   - The target variable is created by classifying credit status: statuses "c", "x", and "0" are labeled as 0 (creditworthy), while values greater than 1 are labeled as 1 (not creditworthy). This results in about 46,000 records with 45,000 creditworthy and 937 minority class (non-creditworthy).
   - Application and credit history datasets are merged on the ID column.
   - Data cleaning includes dropping columns with many missing values (e.g., occupation type), irrelevant columns (e.g., month balance), and columns with no variance (e.g., flag mobile).
   - Categorical variables are encoded using ordinal and label encoders based on logical ordering, and binary variables (e.g., gender) are one-hot encoded.

2. **Outlier Detection and Removal:**
   - Scatter plots identify outliers in continuous variables like children count, income total, and family members.
   - Outliers are removed using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method and visual thresholding, removing about 2,000 data points to yield a cleaned dataset of approximately 34,922 records.

3. **Data Splitting and Scaling:**
   - The dataset is split into independent variables (X) and the target (y), then into training and test sets (80%-20%).
   - A Min-Max Scaler is applied to scale features.

4. **Handling Class Imbalance:**
   - The dataset is highly imbalanced, with only about 2% minority class.
   - Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is applied to generate synthetic minority class samples using k-nearest neighbors, balancing the classes in the training data.

5. **Model Building and Evaluation:**
   - A decision tree classifier is trained on the balanced training data.
   - Predictions on the test set yield an overall accuracy of about 96%.
   - However, precision and recall for the minority class are low (19% and 22%, respectively), indicating poor performance in identifying non-creditworthy applicants.
   - This low minority class performance is attributed to limited data or features and suggests potential improvements through hyperparameter tuning or feature engineering.

6. **Feature Importance and Visualization:**
   - Feature importance analysis shows that income type, income amount, age (days since birth), and employment duration are the most influential features in the decision tree splits, aligning logically with credit approval criteria.
   - A visual representation of the decision tree is created using graph visualization tools, illustrating the decision paths.

Overall, the session demonstrates the end-to-end process of preparing data, handling imbalanced classes with SMOTE, building a decision tree classifier, evaluating its performance beyond accuracy, and interpreting feature importance, while noting areas for future model improvement.</youtube_summary>

- [Understand machine learning](https://youtu.be/5q87K1WaoFI
<youtube_summary>Hillary Mason, a computer scientist, explains machine learning (ML) at increasing levels of complexity through conversations with different people. She defines ML as teaching computers to learn patterns from large data sets to make predictions or recognize new examples, something humans cannot efficiently do at scale.

- With a child, she illustrates ML by showing images of dogs, cats, jackals, and humans, explaining how machines make guesses based on many examples, requiring millions of data points, unlike humans who learn from few examples.

- Talking to a student, she discusses ML applications like recommendation systems (e.g., Spotify suggesting songs based on musical features) and targeted ads on social media that predict user behavior from data. She highlights how machines excel at processing vast data but lack human creativity and judgment.

- With a math and computer science student, she delves into technical ML concepts: supervised learning (using labeled data and feature engineering), unsupervised learning (finding patterns without labels), reinforcement learning (learning via trial and error in decision-making environments), and deep learning (using neural networks and large data). She explains pros and cons of approaches, such as deep learning’s accuracy vs. interpretability issues, and emphasizes the importance of choosing the right method to avoid useless models.

- In a PhD-level discussion on natural language processing (NLP), Mason explores challenges of bias in language models trained on internet text, the difficulty of measuring and mitigating it, and the balance between deep learning's power and the need for interpretable models. She expresses excitement about advances in generative NLP systems and their creative potential.

- In a conversation with a longtime colleague, she reflects on the democratization of ML tools, making it accessible to many but raising challenges around data quality, bias, transparency, and societal impact. They discuss the uneven adoption of ML across industries, the difficulty of obtaining representative data, and the gap between academic research and real-world applications. Despite challenges, she remains optimistic about ML’s potential to reduce harm, improve decision-making, and address major societal problems if fairness and ethical use are prioritized.

Overall, Mason emphasizes that machine learning enables computers to learn from vast data to make predictions and decisions, but it requires careful consideration of data quality, fairness, interpretability, and appropriate application. She highlights the current rapid advances and the unprecedented opportunities to build impactful ML-driven products across industries while acknowledging ongoing challenges in bias, transparency, and societal implications.</youtube_summary>

- [Understand decision trees](https://youtu.be/tNa99PG8hR8
<youtube_summary>In this episode, the focus is on visualizing a decision tree classifier to understand how it works internally. Unlike other classifiers like neural networks or support vector machines, decision trees are easy to read and interpret, making them valuable in practice. The example used is the classic Iris data set, which contains 150 samples of three iris species (setosa, versicolor, virginica), each described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The Iris data is imported from scikit-learn, which provides both the feature data and metadata, including feature names and target labels. The labels are numeric (0, 1, 2) corresponding to the three flower types. The data set is then split by removing one example of each flower type to serve as testing data, while the remainder is used for training the decision tree classifier.

After training, the classifier is tested on the reserved examples, correctly predicting all three flower types. A visualization of the decision tree is created using code from scikit-learn tutorials, producing a readable PDF that shows the tree’s structure. Each node in the tree poses a yes/no question about a feature (e.g., "Is petal width < 0.8 cm?"), guiding the path to a leaf node that predicts the flower type.

The episode walks through classifying testing examples by following the tree’s questions step-by-step, demonstrating how the classifier arrives at correct predictions. It emphasizes that the decision tree’s questions rely solely on the input features, highlighting that better features lead to better trees. Future episodes will delve deeper into how decision trees are constructed automatically and what makes a good feature for classification.</youtube_summary>

## Optional: R, RStudio and Rattle

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is open source and extremely popular for statistical analysis. In recent years, Python has become the de facto standard for data modeling. However, R still plays an important role for many analysts.

- [Getting started with R and RStudio](https://youtu.be/lVKMsaWju8w
<youtube_summary>Mike introduces R, a free, open-source statistical programming language with a large, active community and over 1,300 packages that extend its capabilities, including mapping and graphics used by major organizations like The New York Times, Google, and Facebook. R is a scripting language where users write code and functions.

To get R, visit r-project.org, select your operating system (Mac or Windows), download, and install it. However, Mike advises against using the default R GUI because it is cumbersome.

Instead, he recommends RStudio, a development environment for R available at rstudio.com. RStudio enhances R’s usability with features like:

- A console to run commands.
- A source editor to write and save scripts.
- A workspace showing created variables.
- A history panel to review and reuse past commands.
- A file browser to set and navigate the working directory, which is where R looks for files.
- Package management to add bundles of functions (e.g., "tree" for classification/regression trees, "open street map" for mapping).
- Plotting tools with plot history and export options (e.g., PDF, clipboard).
- Built-in help with function documentation accessible via search.
- Code execution shortcuts (Cmd+Enter on Mac, Ctrl+Enter on Windows), code completion (via Tab), and file path completion.
- Command history navigation and block execution.
- Code navigation with search and replace.
- Project management that saves workspace, history, and layout for easy organization.
- The ability to open multiple documents with tabs and navigate between them.

Mike also highlights resources for learning R, such as:

- The "Step Methods Quick R" website for function lookups and tutorials.
- R Seek, a filtered Google search for R-related content.
- R-bloggers, a community blog with tutorials and new developments.

He concludes by inviting questions and encouraging viewers to subscribe and share to help others become proficient R users. Further videos will cover more practical usage of R and RStudio.</youtube_summary>

The data set used is a popular German credit data set with around 1,000 observations, containing variables such as balance, credit duration, amount, age, occupation, and whether the applicant is a foreigner. The target variable is "credit," coded as 1 for good loans and 0 for bad loans. 

The process begins by importing the CSV data into R via Rattle, which supports various file types and database connections. Variables are assigned roles as inputs or target, with "credit" set as the target variable. The data is then partitioned into training (70%) and validation (30%) sets to enable model building and testing.

Exploratory data analysis is conducted using Rattle's graphical tools like box plots and histograms. For example, box plots revealed that longer loan durations and younger age correlate with higher default rates, while the amount variable showed greater variance among defaulters.

Rattle offers multiple modeling techniques including decision trees (ID3/C4.5), random forest, adaptive boosting, support vector machines, logistic regression, and neural networks. Models can be built individually or all at once with a single click. Tree complexity can be adjusted by changing parameters like minimum split and bucket size.

Model evaluation is done by generating ROC curves and calculating the Area Under the Curve (AUC) on validation data. The best performing models were adaptive boosting, random forest, support vector machines, and logistic regression, with AUCs around 0.80-0.81. The standalone decision tree performed worse (AUC 0.73). Neural networks failed to build a good model here. Ensemble modeling by averaging predictions from multiple models is suggested to improve performance.

Training data evaluation showed higher AUCs, indicating some optimistic bias, but no significant overfitting was observed. Stepwise variable selection is not available in Rattle or R by default and is generally considered overrated; variables can be excluded manually.

In summary, the exercise covered data import, exploration, modeling with multiple algorithms, evaluation via ROC curves, and model comparison using Rattle on R—all without coding. Future videos will cover model deployment. The presenter invites feedback on the training and hopes viewers gained a better understanding of R and Rattle for predictive modeling.</youtube_summary>

## Automate machine learning with PyCaret

[![Automate machine learning with PyCaret](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/WMUt7NOJGbo/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/WMUt7NOJGbo
<youtube_summary>The text introduces Pycaret, an open-source library that automates building end-to-end machine learning pipelines, saving time typically spent on data cleaning, model building, hyperparameter tuning, and saving models. Using a binary classification example with the "juice" dataset, Pycaret simplifies data preprocessing by automatically inferring data types, performing normalization, feature selection, and encoding categorical variables (e.g., one-hot or ordinal encoding). The dataset includes features like purchase week, product prices, discounts, customer loyalty, and store IDs, with the target variable indicating purchase choice between two brands.

Pycaret allows easy experiment setup by specifying the target variable and parameters like normalization, train-test split, and handling imbalanced data with SMOTE. It supports about 17 classification models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, SVM, etc.) and can run all at once using compare_models(), presenting evaluation metrics (accuracy, AUC, recall, precision, F1) to select the best model. Users can also create and save specific models with create_model() and save_model() functions.

Hyperparameter tuning is automated through tune_model(), improving model performance (e.g., increasing accuracy and adjusting parameters such as number of estimators in random forest). Pycaret includes built-in plotting functions for ROC curves, confusion matrices, and feature importance.

For model interpretation, Pycaret integrates with the SHAP library, which explains model predictions by showing how feature values (e.g., customer loyalty, price differences) influence the classification outcome, helping to understand feature impact on target prediction.

Finally, the chosen model can be saved as a pickle file for future use, enabling easy loading and fresh predictions. Overall, Pycaret offers a plug-and-play, automated, and flexible framework for machine learning workflows from data preprocessing to model interpretation and deployment.</youtube_summary>

## Clustering with Python

[![Clustering with Python](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/lcMWH67TiWE/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/lcMWH67TiWE
<youtube_summary>This tutorial covers clustering using the k-means algorithm on a stock market dataset containing multiple company stocks with attributes such as sector, stock price, market cap, stock return percentage, PAT percent, EBIT margin percent, and EPS. The key points are:

1. **Data Preparation:**  
   - Percentage columns except stock returns (e.g., PAT percent, EBIT margin percent) originally range from about -1 to 1, representing -100% to 100%. These are scaled by multiplying by 100 to convert them into a 0-100 scale for better interpretation.
   - Features selected for clustering include columns from price to stock return percentage.
   - Features are standardized using Min-Max scaling (scaling values between 0 and 1) via scikit-learn’s MinMaxScaler.

2. **K-means Clustering:**  
   - The k-means algorithm from scikit-learn is used with k=7 clusters and n_jobs=-1 to utilize all CPU cores.
   - K-means is sensitive to initial random seed values; scikit-learn tries 10 different seeds by default to find the best result.
   - After fitting, cluster labels are assigned to each stock and added back to the original dataset.

3. **Analyzing Clusters:**  
   - Cluster sizes vary widely, with the smallest cluster having 15 stocks and the largest 432.
   - To understand clusters, the mean values of features are computed per cluster.
   - For example, cluster 4 contains stocks with very high average stock returns (~40%) but only 15 stocks.
   - Stocks with poor performance tend to have cheaper prices on average.
   - Stocks with the highest returns also tend to have very large market caps.
   - An interesting outlier is noted in cluster 3: despite a large average earnings per share (EPS), the stock return is strongly negative (~-10%). This suggests EPS might be high due to asset sales rather than operational profit, implying the need for further investigation.

4. **Insights and Takeaways:**  
   - Clustering can help reveal distinct groups of stocks based on performance and financial metrics.
   - Outliers in clusters often carry meaningful information and should not be discarded as averages alone do not tell the full story.
   - K-means clustering results may vary slightly due to sensitivity to random initialization (seed values).
   - Interpreting clusters and extracting business insights is the more valuable and challenging part beyond just running the clustering algorithm.

The tutorial concludes by emphasizing the importance of exploring clusters deeply to build meaningful stories and actionable insights from the data.</youtube_summary>

- [How does K-Means clustering work?](https://youtu.be/4b5d3muPQmA
<youtube_summary>In this Stat Quest episode, Josh Stormer explains k-means clustering, a method to group data points into clusters based on their similarity. The process begins by selecting the number of clusters (K), then randomly choosing initial cluster centers. Each data point is assigned to the nearest cluster based on distance (such as Euclidean distance), and cluster means are recalculated iteratively until assignments stabilize.

Josh demonstrates clustering on one-dimensional data (points on a line), two-dimensional data (XY graph), and higher dimensions (like heatmaps), using Euclidean distance generalized via the Pythagorean theorem. He emphasizes that k-means clustering depends on initial cluster choices, so it is repeated multiple times with different starting points to find the best clustering with the lowest total within-cluster variation.

To determine the optimal number of clusters K, one can run k-means with different K values and plot the reduction in total variance, producing an "elbow plot" where the point of diminishing returns suggests the best K.

K-means differs from hierarchical clustering in that k-means partitions data into a fixed number of clusters specified upfront, while hierarchical clustering reveals pairwise similarities without predetermined cluster counts.

Finally, Josh encourages viewers to subscribe and support Stat Quest for more explanatory videos.</youtube_summary>

## Sentiment analysis with Python and SpaCy

[![Sentiment analysis with Python and SpaCy](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/A9WX7HaS1eU/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/A9WX7HaS1eU
<youtube_summary>This tutorial demonstrates sentiment prediction for text using Python with IMDb movie reviews data. The dataset contains movie reviews along with human-labeled sentiments (positive or negative). The goal is to use the open-source TextBlob library, derived from Google, to compute sentiment scores for each review and compare these results with human labels.

TextBlob provides two scores for text: 
1. Polarity score (ranging from -1 to +1) indicating sentiment (negative to positive).
2. Subjectivity score (ranging from 0 to 1) indicating how subjective the text is.

The focus is on the polarity score for sentiment analysis. The tutorial shows how to apply TextBlob to each review to obtain polarity and subjectivity scores, then convert polarity scores into binary sentiment flags (negative if polarity < 0, positive otherwise) to align with human labels.

Using a classification report (metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score derived from the confusion matrix), the tutorial evaluates TextBlob's predictions against human labels:
- For negative sentiment, TextBlob achieves 88% precision but only around 46% recall, indicating it correctly identifies many predicted negatives but misses about half of actual negatives.
- For positive sentiment, precision and recall are moderate.
- Overall, TextBlob achieves about 76-80% accuracy in matching human-labeled sentiments without any additional training.

The conclusion is that while human labeling is more accurate, TextBlob offers a convenient, pre-trained, ready-to-use sentiment analysis tool that performs reasonably well for positive/negative classification on English movie reviews, making it useful for quick sentiment modeling tasks.</youtube_summary>

- Learn about the [TextBlob module](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/) and [video](https://youtu.be/qTyj2R-wcks
<youtube_summary>This tutorial is part 1 of a mini-series focused on exploring out-of-the-box sentiment analysis libraries, specifically TextBlob and VADER Sentiment. The goal is to test and compare their effectiveness on a challenging dataset of short movie reviews, which includes positive and negative examples, some of which are sarcastic or ambiguous.

TextBlob is a natural language processing library built on NLTK that offers multiple features beyond sentiment analysis, such as translation and part-of-speech tagging. Sentiment analysis in TextBlob returns polarity (ranging from -1 to 1) and subjectivity (from 0 to 1). Initial testing showed TextBlob achieving about 71% accuracy on positive samples and 55% on negative ones. Adjusting thresholds for polarity and subjectivity did not significantly improve results, and the usefulness of subjectivity as a filter was unclear.

VADER Sentiment focuses solely on sentiment analysis and provides scores for negative, neutral, positive, and a compound score combining these. Using the compound score with a simple positive/negative threshold yielded around 69.57% accuracy. Following VADER documentation, introducing a neutral zone threshold (between -0.5 and 0.5) improved accuracy to 87% for positive but only 50% for negative samples, with many samples discarded. Further refining rules to compare positive and negative scores directly improved performance substantially.

Applying a similar neutral zone approach to TextBlob by setting polarity thresholds (e.g., ±0.5, ±0.2, ±0.1) resulted in up to 100% accuracy on fewer samples, highlighting that many texts have zero polarity, which complicates classification.

Performance-wise, TextBlob took about 6.7 seconds to process over 10,000 samples, while VADER took about 3.3 seconds, making VADER roughly twice as fast but slightly less accurate when neutral zones are properly applied.

Overall, TextBlob appears slightly more accurate and offers additional NLP features (translation, POS tagging), while VADER is faster and focused on sentiment. Choosing between them depends on specific needs, and both require carefully defined classification rules, especially regarding neutral or zero polarity cases.

The tutorial encourages experimenting with thresholds and methods to assess confidence levels in classifications and suggests that these approaches can be applied to other sentiment analysis libraries as well. The author plans to integrate sentiment analysis into a database and remains undecided on which library to use. Questions and comments are welcomed for further discussion.</youtube_summary>

## Sentiment analysis with Excel and Azure ML

[![Sentiment analysis with Excel and Azure ML](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/wkbYLFEBCJg/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/wkbYLFEBCJg
<youtube_summary>This tutorial demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis in Excel using Azure Machine Learning Add-ins. Sentiment analysis extracts subjective information from text, useful for understanding public opinion on products or movies via social media posts or reviews.

The example uses an IMDB movie review dataset containing user reviews labeled as positive or negative. The tutorial guides through downloading and installing the Azure Machine Learning Add-in from the Office Store, specifically using its text sentiment analysis feature.

Key steps include:
- Understanding the Add-in’s input schema: it requires a text column as input and provides two outputs—sentiment (positive/negative) and a sentiment score.
- Selecting the input data (about 1936 reviews) and specifying output cells.
- Running the Add-in to generate sentiment predictions and scores, where scores close to 100% indicate strong positivity, close to 0% strong negativity, and around 50% neutrality.

After obtaining results, a pivot table is created to count positive and negative sentiments, showing about 75% negative and 25% positive labels. However, this summary is limited without context to specific movies or brands.

To evaluate the classifier’s performance, a confusion matrix is constructed comparing actual labels to predicted sentiments:
- Of 973 actual negative reviews, 880 were correctly predicted negative, 93 incorrectly positive.
- Of 963 actual positive reviews, 380 were correctly positive, 583 incorrectly negative.
This indicates difficulty in correctly classifying positive reviews.

Performance metrics calculated include:
- Accuracy: approximately 65%
- Precision: about 60% for negative class, 80% for positive class
- Recall: about 90% for negative class, lower for positive class

Comparing these results to a Python-based sentiment analysis on a similar dataset shows conflicting outcomes—Python had higher precision but lower recall for negatives, opposite to Azure Add-in results. Differences likely arise from sample size and data subsets used.

Advantages of using Excel with Azure Add-ins include ease of use, no programming required, and quick initial insights. However, Excel struggles with large datasets (memory errors beyond ~2000 rows), whereas Python can handle much larger data volumes and enables more in-depth analysis.

In summary, Azure Machine Learning Add-ins in Excel provide a convenient, rapid way to perform sentiment analysis on moderate-sized datasets, offering a good starting point before moving to more powerful tools like Python for extensive analysis.</youtube_summary>

## Image auto classification with Google Cloud Vision

[![Image auto classification with Google Cloud Vision](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/z4MUpn4FRTw/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/z4MUpn4FRTw
<youtube_summary>In this session, the presenter demonstrates how to use Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to solve an image classification problem, continuing from a previous lecture where a Keras neural network model showed suboptimal performance. The focus is on using GCP's AutoML Vision, a plug-and-play API for image classification.

Steps covered include:

1. Creating a GCP account and accessing the AutoML Vision product from the GCP dashboard.
2. Downloading and preparing the chessman image dataset used previously, which contains six labels (king, queen, rook, etc.) for a multi-label classification task.
3. Creating a new dataset in AutoML Vision, naming it, and specifying the model objective as multi-label classification.
4. Uploading the dataset images by zipping the labeled folders and storing them in a GCP storage bucket. The bucket must be created with the region set to "us-central1 (Iowa)" for multi-label classification.
5. Uploading approximately 550 images into the bucket, which may take some time depending on internet speed.
6. Training the model through the AutoML Vision interface, noting that training 550 images took about 1.5 hours. GCP sends an email notification upon completion.
7. Reviewing model performance, which showed over 90% precision and recall, significantly better than the prior Keras model.
8. Accessing detailed evaluation reports including precision-recall curves and confusion matrices, showing, for example, perfect prediction of pawns and some confusion between queens and kings.
9. Deploying the model directly from GCP if the performance is satisfactory.

The session highlights that GCP AutoML Vision offers an out-of-the-box, user-friendly solution for image classification without requiring end-to-end model building, delivering state-of-the-art results by simply uploading labeled data and selecting appropriate options.</youtube_summary>

## Image classification with Python (Keras)

[![Image classification with Python](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/59u3XMiSyro/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/59u3XMiSyro
<youtube_summary>The session focuses on image classification using Keras, specifically classifying chess piece images. Image classification is a key area in data science with applications like fingerprint or face recognition and vehicle identification. The tutorial demonstrates how to import a chess piece image dataset directly from Kaggle into Google Colab using the Kaggle API by downloading a JSON file with user credentials, uploading it to Colab, and then downloading and unzipping the dataset, which contains six classes (king, queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawn) totaling 552 images.

The dataset is split into training (80%, 442 images) and validation (20%, 110 images) sets using Keras's preprocessing functions. Sample images are displayed, and the number of images per class is analyzed. The core task is building a convolutional neural network (CNN) with Keras to perform multi-class classification. The CNN model consists of three convolutional layers with 32, 64, and 128 filters, ReLU activation, padding, max pooling layers, followed by flattening and a softmax output layer. The model uses categorical cross-entropy loss and is trained for eight epochs.

The tutorial explains the CNN workings in detail: input images are matrices of pixels; convolution applies filters (like Sobel filters for edge detection) over the image via dot products to extract features, reducing the image size unless padding is used to maintain dimensions by adding zeros around edges. Max pooling reduces spatial dimensions by selecting maximum values over regions to condense features.

Training results show increasing accuracy on the training set but not on validation, indicating possible overfitting and insufficient dataset size. Model performance is further evaluated using a confusion matrix, revealing misclassifications, e.g., bishops often classified as pawns. Suggestions include reducing model complexity or increasing data size.

The session concludes with a preview of the next lecture, which will cover using Google Cloud Platform's AutoML Vision for solving the same problem with an out-of-the-box solution.</youtube_summary>

<youtube_summary>The course by Andy from Deep Lizard teaches how to use Keras, a Python neural network API integrated with TensorFlow, focusing on deep learning concepts with practical code implementations. It starts from data organization and preprocessing, then building and training neural networks, including both custom-built and pre-trained state-of-the-art models fine-tuned on custom datasets.

Prerequisites include basic Python programming skills and some deep learning fundamentals, recommended to be learned via Deep Lizard’s fundamentals course. Resources include video/text content, blogs, quizzes, and downloadable code files available on Deep Lizard's website and Hive Mind membership.

Keras is now fully integrated with TensorFlow, simplifying installation (pip install tensorflow). GPU use is optional but can speed up training; setup guides are provided.

Key course topics and steps include:

1. **Data Preparation and Processing**  
   - Understanding supervised learning datasets: samples (inputs) and labels (targets).  
   - Preparing data in formats accepted by Keras (NumPy arrays, TensorFlow tensors, generators, etc.).  
   - Normalizing/scaling data (e.g., MinMaxScaler to scale numerical data between 0 and 1).  
   - Creating synthetic numerical datasets for initial training exercises.

2. **Building and Training Neural Networks**  
   - Using Keras Sequential API to build models layer-by-layer.  
   - Defining input shape, layers (Dense, Conv2D, MaxPooling), units, and activation functions (ReLU, softmax).  
   - Compiling models with optimizers (Adam), loss functions (sparse categorical crossentropy or categorical crossentropy), and metrics (accuracy).  
   - Training models using `fit` with parameters such as batch size, epochs, shuffling, and verbosity.

3. **Validation and Overfitting**  
   - Creating validation sets either by splitting training data (validation_split) or using a separate validation dataset.  
   - Monitoring training and validation loss/accuracy per epoch to detect overfitting.  
   - Overfitting occurs when training accuracy is high but validation accuracy lags.  
   - Importance of shuffling data before splitting to avoid biased validation sets.

4. **Inference and Evaluation**  
   - Using trained models to predict on unseen test data (inference).  
   - Preparing test data in the same format as training data.  
   - Interpreting prediction outputs (probability distributions per class), extracting most probable class labels.  
   - Visualizing performance with confusion matrices, showing correct vs. incorrect predictions per class.

5. **Saving and Loading Models**  
   - Saving entire models (architecture, weights, training config) with `model.save()` and loading with `load_model()`.  
   - Saving just architecture as JSON or YAML strings, requiring manual reconstruction and retraining.  
   - Saving and loading weights separately, requiring model architecture to be defined before weights loading.

6. **Working with Image Data and CNNs**  
   - Downloading and organizing image datasets (e.g., Kaggle Cats vs Dogs).  
   - Structuring directories for train, validation, and test sets with subfolders per class.  
   - Using Keras ImageDataGenerator and `flow_from_directory` to create batches for training, validation, and testing, with resizing and preprocessing (e.g., VGG16 preprocessing).  
   - Building convolutional neural networks with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Flatten, Dense layers.  
   - Observing overfitting in simple CNNs: high training accuracy but low validation accuracy.

7. **Fine-Tuning Pretrained Models (Transfer Learning)**  
   - Importing pretrained models like VGG16 and MobileNet trained on ImageNet.  
   - Adapting pretrained models by removing original output layers and adding new output layers matching the custom dataset classes.  
   - Freezing layers to prevent retraining of pretrained weights except for the new output layer (or more layers for deeper fine-tuning).  
   - Fine-tuning results: VGG16 achieves high accuracy quickly on cats and dogs due to prior training on those classes; MobileNet fine-tuned on a new sign language digits dataset also achieves good performance.  
   - Preprocessing inputs to match the original training preprocessing of the pretrained model (e.g., mean RGB subtraction for VGG16, scaling for MobileNet).

8. **Data Augmentation**  
   - Using Keras ImageDataGenerator to augment image data with transformations like rotation, shift, shear, zoom, color channel shifts, and flipping.  
   - Augmentation helps increase dataset size and reduce overfitting by introducing variability.  
   - Example augmentation applied to a dog image, demonstrating changes like rotation, shift, and flip.  
   - Optionally saving augmented images to disk for expanding training datasets.

Throughout, the course includes practical code examples in Jupyter Notebooks, explanations of key concepts such as activation functions, layers, loss functions, and includes links to blogs and quizzes for deeper learning. It also emphasizes best practices like data shuffling and discusses trade-offs between model size, speed, and accuracy, especially when comparing large models like VGG16 with lightweight models like MobileNet suitable for mobile devices.

Overall, the course provides a comprehensive guide to deep learning with Keras and TensorFlow, covering from basics of data processing to advanced topics like fine-tuning pretrained models and data augmentation, supported by practical coding and useful resources.</youtube_summary>

## Narratives with Quill on Tableau

-[![Narratives with Quill on Tableau](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b_Qojb9gLzA/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/b_Qojb9gLzA
<youtube_summary>This tutorial demonstrates how to use Quill, a Tableau extension that converts visualizations into narratives, by applying it to a Covid-19 dataset. 

Steps covered include:

1. Downloading and installing the Quill extension (.trex file) from the official site after filling in necessary details.

2. Opening Tableau, connecting to the Covid-19 Excel dataset, and preparing the data by setting the geographic role of the location field to "Country Region" for map visualizations.

3. Creating three visualizations:
   - A map showing the average percentage of people aged 70 or older per country (changing aggregation from sum to average to avoid incorrect totals).
   - A treemap chart displaying the total new deaths by country.
   - A sorted chart of the Stringency Index (0-100 scale, indicating strictness of Covid-19 measures) averaged per country.

4. Combining these three visualizations into a dashboard, adjusting colors and layout.

5. Adding the Quill narrative extension to the dashboard by accessing local extensions and selecting the Quill .trex file.

6. Configuring Quill for each sheet by selecting appropriate dimensions and measures, and generating automatic narratives describing the data, such as average age over 70 percentages, total deaths, and stringency indices.

7. Customizing the narratives to improve clarity and relevance by:
   - Renaming dimensions (e.g., "entity" to "country"/"countries").
   - Changing measure labels to meaningful phrases like "average age over 70".
   - Adjusting aggregation methods (using average instead of sum where appropriate).
   - Removing redundant or unhelpful lines such as minimum and maximum values.
   - Editing or switching off specific narrative lines to avoid obvious or misleading statements.

The tutorial emphasizes refining narratives to provide insightful, concise storytelling that complements the visual data, demonstrating how Quill enhances Tableau dashboards by automatically generating contextual explanations based on the visualizations.</youtube_summary>

## Comic narratives with Google Sheets & Comicgen

[![Comic narratives with Google Sheets & Comicgen](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HZDqCQBpHGI/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/HZDqCQBpHGI
<youtube_summary>This tutorial introduces Comicgen, a tool for creating comics, and demonstrates how to use these comics to tell stories about data, specifically clustering results. The presenter shows Comicgen's features, such as selecting comic characters (e.g., Dee), adjusting their poses, emotions, and speech bubbles with customizable text, pointers, colors, and fonts. Created images or URLs can be downloaded or copied for use.

The tutorial applies Comicgen to a stock dataset previously used for clustering, emphasizing that the key value of clustering lies in storytelling about each cluster. Comics make these stories more engaging and visually appealing. An example comic depicts a character discussing stock decisions and cluster analysis results, with each cluster characterized by features like EPS, market cap, and stock return, accompanied by color-coded indicators (e.g., green for positive clusters).

Initially, comics and speech bubbles are created statically by hardcoding text and image URLs mapped to each cluster. The presenter explains how to dynamically generate comics by linking cluster data to character poses, emotions, and speech bubble text using dictionaries and URL encoding in Excel. The comic content updates automatically when cluster data changes, enhancing interactivity.

Further improvements include categorizing numerical data into high, medium, and low based on quartiles and generating human-readable descriptions that highlight only notable high or low values. The speech bubble width adjusts dynamically to content length, and introductory phrases for clusters are randomly selected from predefined options for variety.

The tutorial concludes by highlighting Comicgen as a fun, effective tool for creating visually appealing, dynamic data narratives that can be integrated into websites or presentations. The approach can be extended beyond comics to other dynamic visualizations like charts, providing engaging ways to communicate data insights to stakeholders.</youtube_summary>

## Optional: Scaling hotstar.com for 25 million concurrent viewers

[![Optional : Scaling hotstar.com](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QjvyiyH4rr0/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/QjvyiyH4rr0
<youtube_summary>Gaurav, a Cloud Architect at Hotstar, discussed managing infrastructure security and handling massive concurrency during major cricket events on Hotstar. He presented concurrency and traffic patterns from a rain-affected India vs. New Zealand match, highlighting how traffic typically hovered around 10 million concurrent users but spiked rapidly to 25 million within minutes due to push notifications during key moments, such as Dhoni coming to bat. Despite rain delays causing dips, millions stayed glued to the stream, showing platform resilience.

Hotstar broke global concurrency records multiple times, reaching 25.3 million concurrent users, surpassing YouTube's previous record of 8 million during a 2012 livestream. The platform handled about 1 million requests per second and consumed 10 terabytes of video bandwidth per second, nearly 70-75% of India's total internet bandwidth.

To prepare for such scale, Hotstar conducts extensive load testing called "game days" using over 3,000 high-performance machines distributed across eight AWS regions to avoid overwhelming any single edge location. This load testing simulates realistic traffic patterns based on machine learning models analyzing prior data, including sudden surges ("tsunami traffic") and drops, to identify system breaking points and bottlenecks.

Scaling challenges include AWS Auto Scaling limitations such as single instance type per Auto Scaling Group (ASG), slow step sizes for scaling (adding servers in increments of 10-20), and uneven capacity across availability zones (AZs) causing provisioning delays. To overcome these, Hotstar developed a proprietary auto-scaling tool that scales proactively based on request rates and concurrency metrics rather than CPU utilization, with buffers to handle rapid traffic growth of up to 1 million new users per minute. They also use secondary ASGs with different instance types and spot fleets to diversify capacity and reduce risk of insufficient AZ capacity.

Hotstar avoids configuration management tools like Chef or Puppet to reduce server boot times, instead using fully baked AMIs and container images to ensure fast, reliable startup. They proactively pre-warm infrastructure before matches and maintain buffer capacity.

Chaos engineering is integral to Hotstar's approach, simulating failures such as network outages, database failures, and CDN edge location issues to discover hidden vulnerabilities and ensure graceful degradation. For example, if a CDN edge goes down, traffic redirected to origin servers can cause massive load spikes that must be anticipated. The goal is to keep critical services like video playback, ads, subscriptions, and payments ("P0 services") always available, while non-essential services like personalization and recommendations can be temporarily disabled ("panic mode") to preserve capacity during peak loads or failures. Panic mode also involves returning custom success codes to clients to avoid user-facing errors and allow continued usage despite backend issues (e.g., allowing video playback without login if login service is down).

Understanding detailed user journeys and API call patterns is crucial for capacity planning and load testing. Hotstar benchmarks each microservice's rated capacity in requests per second to avoid overload and implements backfill or caching strategies to handle spikes.

Challenges remain due to fixed internet bandwidth limits, especially last-mile latency and ISP throttling in certain regions. Hotstar continuously learns from failures and iterates on scaling strategies, with preparations for events like IPL starting well in advance.

Automation for chaos engineering is homegrown, primarily Python-based using AWS Boto SDK, scripting network failures, route table changes, and other fault injections based on past incident patterns and random experiments. Panic mode is implemented via feature toggles at client and backend levels, returning custom 200 OK responses instead of errors, allowing graceful degradation of services like payments or login.

In summary, Hotstar's success in handling unprecedented scale for live sports streaming relies on proactive, data-driven scaling, extensive distributed load testing, chaos engineering to anticipate failures, and intelligent graceful degradation to maintain user experience under extreme conditions.</youtube_summary>

- [Using Inspect element to find APIs](https://youtu.be/_gpBxglbDY4
<youtube_summary>The user is having trouble finding the location API for cities on the BBC Weather website using the browser's inspect element and network tools. The suggested solution is to open the BBC Weather site, first open the inspect element and go to the Network tab before searching for a city. This way, the network requests will be clear, and when the city name is entered, the location data will appear in the most recent network requests. If there are too many existing requests, the user should reload the page to clear them, then search for the city. Searching first and then opening the inspect element makes it harder to find the location data because of numerous previous requests. Following this method should help locate the city location API successfully.</youtube_summary>

- Learn about the [urllib.parse package](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html). [Video](https://youtu.be/LosIGgon_KM
<youtube_summary>The web has more pages than people on Earth, each likely containing valuable original content. While most access web pages via browsers, programmers can use other methods such as Python to send GET requests and parse responses, automating website reading. A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) consists of a protocol (scheme), host name, optional port (default 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS), path, query string (key-value pairs after a question mark), and an optional fragment (after a hashtag) to jump to sections on a page.

Python 3 includes the "urllib" package, which has five modules: request (for opening URLs), response (used internally), error (error classes), parse (functions to dissect URLs), and robotparser (to check robots.txt permissions for bots). The tutorial focuses on the request module. After importing urllib, you import urllib.request to access its functions. The key function is "urlopen," which opens a URL and returns a response object (not the same as urllib’s response module).

For example, opening Wikipedia’s homepage with urlopen returns a response with code 200, indicating success. The response size can be checked, and a small part can be previewed using the "peek" method, revealing a bytes object (not a string) since web servers may serve binary data. Reading the full response returns bytes, which must be decoded (e.g., using UTF-8) to get a string with the webpage’s HTML. Note that reading the response once closes the connection, so it cannot be read again.

Attempting to scrape Google search results returns a 403 error, as the server refuses the request to prevent misuse. Alternatively, accessing a YouTube video page with query parameters for video ID (v) and start time (t) can be done by constructing the URL using the parse module's "urlencode" function to create the query string from a dictionary. After building the URL and opening it with urlopen, the connection remains open (checked by "isclosed"), the response code is 200, and the decoded HTML can be viewed.

Thus, Python allows programmatic interaction with web servers beyond browsers. Future topics include sending POST or PUT requests, handling cookies, authentication, and more advanced techniques, which will be covered in upcoming lessons.</youtube_summary>

   - Renaming files or folders with os.rename().

3. Accessing file information:
   - Using os.stat() to retrieve file metadata like size and modification time.
   - Converting modification timestamps into human-readable datetime format using the datetime module.

4. Traversing directory trees:
   - Using os.walk(), a generator that yields directory paths, subdirectories, and files, useful for searching or managing large directory structures.

5. Working with environment variables:
   - Accessing environment variables via os.environ, demonstrated by retrieving the user's home directory.

6. Handling file paths:
   - Combining paths correctly using os.path.join() to avoid errors with slashes.
   - Extracting file or directory names using os.path.basename() and os.path.dirname().
   - Checking path existence with os.path.exists().

# Deployment

[![Deployment](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/YSGZjCxhIkk/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/YSGZjCxhIkk
<youtube_summary>The final step in data science courses is deploying results to share work for others to see, use, and understand. Deployment involves three key parts:

1. **Anonymizing Data**: Sometimes required to protect personally identifiable information (PII) like customer names or credit card details before sharing results. This may involve masking data or creating fake data using tools like ARX (a UI-based anonymization tool) or libraries like Faker. An example is anonymizing plant or product names in a dashboard by replacing them with generic labels or combinations of words to maintain hierarchical data context. However, anonymization is sensitive and may not fully prevent identification, requiring careful review. Industries like pharmaceuticals and financial services strictly require anonymization for regulatory compliance.

2. **Building the Application**: After analysis and modeling, results must be packaged into an application that users can interact with. There are three main approaches:
   - **Notebooks** (e.g., Jupyter, Kaggle, Google Colab): Easy to create and modify but require coding knowledge to use.
   - **Data Apps using Libraries**: Tools like Streamlit (Python) or Shiny (R) create interactive apps with user-friendly widgets, balancing ease of use and development effort.
   - **Full-fledged Web Apps**: Developed with frameworks like Flask or Tornado, offering the best user experience but requiring more development work.

An example Streamlit app analyzes Goodreads reading habits, showing interactive widgets and data summaries.

3. **Hosting the Application**: To allow access, apps must be hosted:
   - Simple hosting includes sharing notebooks or static pages on platforms like Google Drive, GitHub, Dropbox, or Office 365.
   - Specialized app hosting platforms like Heroku or Glitch support deploying apps in various languages with minimal setup.
   - For greater control and integration with specific infrastructure needs (e.g., SAP connectors or Windows automation), virtual machines via cloud services like AWS or Azure are used, though they require more management.

An example Heroku-hosted app is a Wordle game, demonstrating simple but powerful app deployment.

While data scientists typically finish their work at deployment, developers continue with securing and scaling apps, tasks associated with DevOps. The initial deployment steps fall under ML Ops, focusing on automating and making results accessible.

This module introduces tools like ARX for anonymization, Streamlit for app building, and Heroku for hosting. The goal is to understand the objectives and explore various tools to gain a broad perspective, enabling informed choices when applying deployment in practice.</youtube_summary>

## Tools to anonymize data

[![Tools to anonymize data](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/N8I-sxmMfqQ/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/N8I-sxmMfqQ
<youtube_summary>The screencast demonstrates the basic functionalities of the data anonymization tool ARX, which uses a project-based graphical user interface. Users start by creating a project and loading a dataset from CSV, Excel, or relational databases; the example uses a 1994 US Census extract from a CSV file. In the initial view, users can exclude columns and set data types, which can be modified later. The interface shows the dataset, subsets for transformation, and attribute overviews where users define attribute types (e.g., direct or quasi-identifiers) and data types (numeric or string), and create or edit generalization hierarchies.

For example, all attributes are considered quasi-identifiers. The attribute "sex" (categorical) uses a hierarchy combining male and female values, while the numeric attribute "age" is set as integer with a hierarchy based on intervals (0-5, 10, 20, 40, 80 years) including top coding for values exceeding a threshold. Hierarchies can be imported/exported via CSV or edited directly.

ARX supports privacy criteria including k-anonymity, delta-presence, l-diversity, and t-closeness, with multiple variants for the latter two. In the example, k-anonymity is set with k=5. Users also specify the maximum percentage of outliers removable during anonymization; here, 100% is allowed to balance suppression and generalization for optimal data utility. Additional settings include methods for measuring data utility, attribute weighting (with age given higher importance), and preferences between generalization and suppression (default equal weighting).

Upon initiating anonymization, ARX classifies the entire solution space (about 18,000 transformations) in roughly 4 seconds, selecting the optimal transformation that meets privacy criteria while minimizing information loss. The analysis perspective compares original and transformed datasets side-by-side, highlighting equivalence classes and providing statistical info like frequency distributions and contingency tables. Metadata about input and transformed data includes entry counts, attribute classifications, number of outliers removed (3,530 of 30,162 in the example), and equivalence class sizes. Although age was weighted more heavily, the optimal transformation used intervals of size 10; the user prefers intervals ≤5.

The exploration perspective allows browsing and organizing transformations in a graphical view of the solution space, with nodes representing transformations labeled by generalization levels. Users can zoom, scroll, filter by utility range, set constraints on generalization levels, add transformations to a clipboard, and add comments. The example adds the global optimum to the clipboard, then filters for a transformation with age generalized to 5-year intervals and data utility close to the optimum. This alternative has slightly more outliers (~5,000, ~17%) but is deemed acceptable. After applying this transformation and verifying it in analysis, the anonymized dataset is exported to CSV.

ARX also provides context-sensitive help accessible via a question mark icon in each view.</youtube_summary>

## Libraries to build web applications

[![Libraries to build web applications](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/iT5sS1dWMcc/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/iT5sS1dWMcc
<youtube_summary>The video explains how to deploy a credit card approval prediction machine learning model using Streamlit and Google Colab with ngrok for local browser access. Streamlit is a Python library that facilitates easy deployment of ML models by creating user interfaces for input and output. The deployment process involves installing Streamlit and ngrok in Google Colab, authenticating ngrok to generate a public URL (usually on port 8501), and running the Streamlit app via the command `streamlit run app.py`. 

In the `app.py` file, necessary libraries like pandas and Streamlit are imported. Streamlit functions such as `st.write()` and `st.header()` are used to display text and headers in the app. User inputs are captured through widgets: categorical variables via `st.selectbox()` (e.g., gender selection with options 'M' or 'F') and continuous variables via `st.number_input()` with specified min, max, and step values (e.g., income or days of birth). These inputs are collected into a dictionary, converted to a pandas DataFrame, and displayed back to the user for confirmation.

Next, the input data undergoes preprocessing similar to the model training phase, including encoding categorical features and converting all inputs to numerical form. The preprocessed input is shown to the user before prediction. The stored machine learning model (`finalized_model.sav`) is then loaded to make predictions. The app displays the prediction results under subheaders, showing the predicted class label (approved or declined) and the associated prediction probabilities. Users can modify input parameters to see updated predictions in real time.

Overall, this approach demonstrates how to locally deploy a machine learning application using Streamlit and ngrok for interactive web-based model prediction interfaces.</youtube_summary>

## Services to host web applications

[![Services to host web applications](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/V5dl7zkKXC0/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/V5dl7zkKXC0
<youtube_summary>This tutorial explains how to deploy a Streamlit application on Heroku using GitHub. Heroku is a platform for publishing web applications online. First, log into Heroku (or create a free account) and access the dashboard. Create a new app (in this case, named for a credit card approval task). In the Deploy section, select GitHub as the deployment method, then connect your GitHub account and link the relevant repository (e.g., "streamlet-heroku"). Ensure this GitHub repo is public so Heroku can access it.

The GitHub project should include key files: 
- `requirements.txt` listing all necessary packages with versions,
- `app.py` which handles user input, preprocessing, model prediction, and output,
- `setup.sh` which instructs Heroku to create a folder, set the default port (8501), and run the Streamlit app.

Heroku provides a virtual machine where these steps run. In the `Procfile`, the start command specifies running the shell script and then the Streamlit app, indicating it is a web app.

After connecting GitHub to Heroku, deploy the desired branch (usually main/master). Heroku builds the environment, installs packages, sets up a SQLite database to store user inputs, and finally deploys the model. The deployed app is accessible via a URL formatted as `https://<heroku_app_name>.herokuapp.com`.

Opening this URL shows the Streamlit web interface with input fields (e.g., gender and other features), displays preprocessed inputs, and outputs prediction probabilities. This process enables you to publish your Streamlit model on the web through Heroku using GitHub integration.</youtube_summary>

# Data Discovery

[![Data discovery](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/3OeMOb7gByE/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/3OeMOb7gByE
<youtube_summary>The first module of the Data Science journey focuses on discovering datasets. It covers three main topics: identifying different sources of datasets and where to find them, understanding the types of datasets (structured, unstructured, and semi-structured), and recognizing the different kinds of values within each dataset. This knowledge helps you locate the desired dataset, whether on the internet, within your organization, or on your phone.</youtube_summary>
)

Before we begin the data science journey, you first need the data set. And to get the
data set, you need to know where it is. This is what we will be covering in the first module.

How do you discover data? There are three things that you will learn in this module.

- The first is, what are the different sources of data sets? Where can you find them?
- The second is, what are the different kinds of data sets? Structured, unstructured and semi-structured.
- Third, in each data set, what are the different kinds of values that you will find?

This will give you a sense of locating the kind of data set that you want, either on the internet
or within your organization or even within your phones.

## Sources of Data

[![Sources of Data](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/GY5l_5RpVZM/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/GY5l_5RpVZM
<youtube_summary>Datasets come from three main sources: Public, Private, and Personal.

1. Public Data:
- Public data is open and free, searchable online, but often difficult to find exactly what you want due to volume, format, or availability.
- Useful starting points include:
  - Awesome Public Datasets catalog on GitHub, which categorizes datasets (e.g., agriculture, social sciences, finance, GIS).
    - Example: GDELT global events database with 2.5TB of news/event data.
    - Finance datasets include Google Finance API, OANDA, EDGAR.
    - GIS datasets like GADM offer detailed administrative maps by country and subdivisions.
  - Google Dataset Search, a specialized search engine for datasets, allows filtering by update time, usage rights, and format. Though helpful, it is still developing and may not find all datasets.
  - Kaggle Datasets, a community-driven platform hosting datasets uploaded by users, including for competitions or learning (e.g., Harry Potter, fanfiction, movie datasets).
  - Government portals (e.g., data.gov, data.gov.in, data.gov.uk) provide authoritative but sometimes incomplete or imperfect official datasets for regions or countries.
  - Data communities like India’s DataMeet help users find datasets through collaboration and discussion.

2. Private Data:
- Private datasets are usually restricted within organizations due to sensitivity, confidentiality, or competitive advantage.
- Examples include employee lists, financial records, product specs, production logs.
- Private datasets are often highly invested in and critical for internal operations.
- Some private data is purchasable from vendors (e.g., Dun and Bradstreet, Hoovers, Statista, Bright Data), often offering more reliable or extensive collections in areas like finance.
- Paid datasets provide a commercial alternative when public data is insufficient.

3. Personal Data:
- Personal data is unique to individuals, stored on their devices or apps, and accessible only by them.
- Examples include call logs, message histories, music listening patterns, health and fitness tracking, email, calendar entries, social media activity, financial transactions, and entertainment preferences.
- Extracting data from apps (messages, WhatsApp, health apps, email, calendar) reveals detailed personal behavior patterns like communication habits, sleep trends, spending, and entertainment preferences.
- Personal data can also come from manual logs such as diaries or diet tracking.
- Any form of personal logging, digital or physical, constitutes potential personal data for analysis.

In summary, dataset sources vary by accessibility and scope: public data is broad but sometimes hard to find and imperfect; private data is often sensitive and internal or purchasable; personal data is highly individualized and derived from personal device usage and logging. Various tools and communities exist to help locate and utilize these datasets effectively.</youtube_summary>

## Types of datasets

[![Types of datasets](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/u8PIxqsi1kk/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/u8PIxqsi1kk
<youtube_summary>Data from any source can range from structured to unstructured, with semi-structured data in between. Structured data has a known schema with defined fields and types, such as database tables, spreadsheets, or shape files containing geographic information. These data sets have clearly defined columns, types, constraints, and interrelationships, enabling operations like joins across multiple tables or worksheets. For example, a census database table has fixed integer and text fields, and shape files combine spatial and tabular data.

Semi-structured data lies between structured and unstructured, containing some organization but lacking a rigid schema. Examples include PDFs with multiple tables, HTML documents like Wikipedia pages combining structured and unstructured information, emails and SMS messages containing structured headers and unstructured text or attachments, and container file formats (e.g., zip, docx, pptx) that hold varied data types. These require effort to discern or extract an underlying schema.

Unstructured data is largely unknown in format and content beyond broad parsing methods. Examples include photos, text, audio, and video files. While humans can interpret such data easily, systems find processing and extracting meaningful information challenging. Current research, especially in deep learning, focuses on converting unstructured data—such as video imagery—into structured forms by identifying entities, speech content, locations, or similarities.

Overall, data exists on a continuum from fully structured to fully unstructured. Much of data extraction work involves transforming unstructured or semi-structured data into structured formats, which facilitates easier analysis and processing.</youtube_summary>

- Structured data has a schema: Databases, Spreadsheets, Forms, Shapefiles
- Semi-structured data has a flexible schema: JSON, HTML, Email
- Unstructured data has no schema: Text, Images, Audio, Video

## Types of values

[![Types of values](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HlsqT0r9wAM/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/HlsqT0r9wAM
<youtube_summary>Data values in datasets can be broadly categorized into three types: categorical, numerical, and composite, each with distinct characteristics and operations.

1. Categorical Values:
- Allow limited computations such as listing or sorting.
- Examples include colors (red, blue, green).
- Subtypes:
  a. Boolean: Two values (true/false, yes/no).
  b. Unordered categories: Distinct categories with no inherent sequence (e.g., colors, cities by name).
  c. Ordered categories: Values with a sequence (e.g., low, medium, high; letters A, B, C).
  d. Cyclical sequences: Ordered but repeating sequences (e.g., days of the week, months).
  e. Unstructured categorical: Infinite, non-enumerable values like free text, images, videos.
- Derived attributes can be extracted from categorical data, such as population of a city, string length, sentiment from text, or face recognition in images, although direct operations on categorical data are limited.

2. Numerical Values:
- Include integers (negative, positive, whole numbers, natural numbers), real numbers (fractions, decimals), and transcendental numbers (e.g., e, pi).
- Support numerous mathematical operations like addition, multiplication, and ratio calculations.

3. Composite Values:
- Combine multiple elements or fields into a structured unit.
- Examples include dates (day, month, year), times (hours, minutes, seconds), spatial data (coordinates, polygons, arcs), and structured documents (XML, JSON).
- Specialized composites include IP addresses (IPv4 with four integers 0-255, IPv6 with six integers 0-255) and currencies (numbers with specific prefixes like USD or GBP).
- Composite types allow more complex operations and data extraction due to their multi-field nature, encompassing and extending beyond categorical and numerical capabilities.

In summary, categorical data is limited in direct computations but can yield derived attributes; numerical data supports extensive mathematical operations; composite data integrates multiple values, enabling a wide range of complex analyses.</youtube_summary>
)

- Categorical values may be:
  - Boolean: True or False
  - Unordered: No order, like colors
  - Ordered: Order, like ratings
  - Cyclical: Like days of the week
  - Unstructured: Like names, images
- Numerical values may be:
  - Integer: You can add or subtract
  - Real: You can multiply or divide
- Composite values have an internal structure
  - Temporal: Date, Time
  - Spatial: Latitude, Longitude, Shapefiles
  - Structured: JSON, XML with schema
  - Specialized: IP addresses, URLs, Email addresses, Phone numbers, etc.

## Week Summary

[![Discover the Data - Summary](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/NNiFxgANu8Y/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/NNiFxgANu8Y
<youtube_summary>This module teaches two key skills: finding data and understanding its type. Finding more data enables more extensive analysis, giving a competitive advantage. Understanding data types helps identify which data sets are easier to work with. Structured data is easier to use since it requires no extra extraction. Numerical data is simpler to handle than categorical or composite data because it has a clearer structure. By recognizing data types, you can choose data sets that yield better results with less time and effort.</youtube_summary>
)

Based on what you have learnt in this module, you should be able to do two things: find data and understand what type of data it is.

Both of these are powerful skills.

The more data you are able to find, the more analysis that you will be able to do that others are unable to.
Therefore, discovering new sources of data is a competitive advantage and a skill that is well worth building.

The other, in terms of understanding the type of data, will give you an edge in terms of knowing which data set is easier to work with.
Structured data is easier to work with because you don't have to do any additional work.
You don't have to extract information from it.
Numerical values are easier to work with than, let's say, categorical or composite because there's less effot to extract the structure.
So you'll be able to compare two data sets and say that one gets more results by spending in less time and effort.

## Sample questions

- Find the UCI machine learning dataset on Wine Quality. (It has 4,898 rows.) What is the highest pH value of the red wines? (ANS: 4.01)
- What's the official data portal of Russia? (ANS: <https://data.gov.ru/?language=en>)
- Are research papers structured, semi-structured or unstructured? (ANS: Semi-structured. They have author names, abstracts, keywords, etc. but most content is free-form.)
- Are book titles categorical or composite? (ANS: Categorical. They don't have an underlying structure.)

## Optional: Tools used in the industry

Kathir Mani from QueLit and Anand S from Gramener discuss the tools and technologies used in the industry. (9 min)

[![Podcast (9 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/DH0Q4LiSgkE/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/DH0Q4LiSgkE
<youtube_summary>The speaker discusses the data science tools they use and have observed in the industry. Primarily, they use Python with Jupyter Notebook and VS Code for development and data analysis, although they acknowledge JupyterLab offers better data frame visualization. For dashboard creation, Tableau is popular in corporate and educational settings. They frequently use Python packages like Streamlit for creating quick demo applications and have noticed growing industry use of the package "Radio" for showcasing machine learning models, which integrates well with libraries like scikit-learn.

In VS Code, they experiment with Docker-related extensions for containerized development and remote machine connections, though their experience is limited. For coding assistance, they use some formatting and linting extensions but do not recall specific names. In Jupyter Notebook, their common libraries include pandas, scikit-learn, Keras, PyTorch, OS, and datetime. For data engineering tasks like database connections, they use MySQL Workbench and pandas' read_sql functions, often combined with SQLAlchemy to prevent SQL injection.

Regarding student requests, learners often want to work with large, raw, uncleaned datasets to practice data cleaning and transformation processes before applying machine learning models, as many courses provide only pre-cleaned datasets. The speaker notes some tools that automate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visuals are overhyped because they generate charts without meaningful insights.

Finally, the speaker recommends following Kaggle notebooks from recent competitions as a valuable resource for learning code optimization, handling large datasets, and exploring new or hybrid machine learning models. They find Kaggle particularly useful both for themselves as a trainer and for students. The conversation concludes with permission to publish this discussion as a podcast episode.</youtube_summary>

<youtube_summary>This comprehensive Python course covers everything needed to start programming in Python, emphasizing Python's popularity, ease of use, and job market demand. It begins with installing Python 3 and setting up the PyCharm IDE, highlighting the choice between Python 2 (legacy) and Python 3 (recommended for beginners). The course guides through creating and running basic Python programs, including printing output and drawing shapes with print statements.

Key programming concepts are introduced progressively:

- Variables: Storing data like strings, numbers, and Booleans; modifying variable values; and using variables to manage data efficiently.
- Strings: Creating, manipulating (concatenation, case conversion, length, indexing, finding, replacing), and escaping characters.
- Numbers: Using integers and floats; performing arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus; using math functions like abs, pow, max, min, round, floor, ceil, and sqrt with the math module.
- User Input: Obtaining input from users, storing it in variables, converting input strings to numbers (int, float), and creating interactive scripts.
- Projects: Building a basic calculator and a Mad Libs game to practice input, variables, and string manipulation.
- Lists: Creating lists with multiple data types; accessing, slicing, modifying, adding (append, insert, extend), removing (remove, pop, clear), counting, sorting, reversing, and copying elements.
- Tuples: Creating immutable sequences; differences between tuples and lists; when to use tuples.
- Functions: Defining and calling functions; using parameters and return statements; organizing code for reuse and clarity.
- Conditional Statements: Using if, else, elif; logical operators (and, or, not); Boolean expressions; comparison operators; nested conditions; practical examples like max number finder and advanced calculator.
- Dictionaries: Storing data in key-value pairs; creating, accessing, using get with default values; keys must be unique; practical use cases like month name conversion.
- Loops: While loops for repeated execution based on conditions; for loops to iterate over strings, lists, ranges; nested loops; examples include counting, iterating through collections, and building a guessing game.
- File Handling: Opening, reading (read, readline, readlines), writing, appending files; file modes (read, write, append, read+write); closing files; reading line-by-line and looping through file contents; caution with writing/appending to avoid data loss or format issues.
- Error Handling: Using try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions (e.g., ValueError, ZeroDivisionError); printing error messages; best practices for specific exception handling.
- Modules: Importing external Python files (modules) to reuse functions and variables; using built-in and third-party modules; installing third-party modules with pip; locating installed modules; uninstalling modules; example of using a custom module and installing a package like python-docx.
- Object-Oriented Programming: Defining classes and creating objects; modeling real-world entities (e.g., Student class with attributes and methods); using the __init__ method to initialize objects; accessing object attributes; defining class methods (functions within classes) that operate on object data; example of an honors check method.
- Inheritance: Creating subclasses that inherit methods and attributes from parent classes; extending or overriding parent class behavior; example with Chef and ChineseChef classes demonstrating method inheritance and overriding.
- Python Interpreter: Using the interactive Python shell (via terminal or command prompt) to quickly test code snippets, define variables, functions, and execute statements; suited for experimentation but not for full programs.

The course provides practical examples and projects (calculator, Mad Libs, guessing game, multiple choice quiz) to reinforce learning and demonstrate real-world applications of Python programming concepts. It encourages exploring Python modules, practicing with classes and functions, and mastering control structures to build efficient and organized code.</youtube_summary>

  1. [About Scrapy & Chrome Web Scraper Extension](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QZPJIfg98-Gox7_tqzrqPy9PigYfRfgpsYgTHcBAYFM/view) [(Video)](https://youtu.be/s4jtkzHhLzY
<youtube_summary>The video demonstrates how to create a web scraper using Scrapy, a powerful Python framework for web scraping, to extract product data (name, price, and link) from a whiskey online store and save it to JSON or CSV files.

Key steps covered:

1. **Setup:**
   - Create a project folder.
   - Use a Python virtual environment for the project.
   - Install Scrapy via pip.
   - Start a new Scrapy project named "whiskey scraper".
   
2. **Exploration and Data Extraction:**
   - Use the Scrapy shell to fetch the target URL (the scotch whiskey section with 746 results).
   - Inspect the webpage’s HTML structure to find CSS selectors for product details.
   - Extract product items using `response.css()` targeting the relevant div class.
   - Extract product name, price (cleaning the currency symbol), and product link (href attribute).
   - Handle cases where products are out of stock by implementing try-except blocks to avoid errors.

3. **Spider Creation:**
   - Create a spider file `spider.py` inside the spiders folder.
   - Define a spider class inheriting from `scrapy.Spider` with name and start URLs.
   - Implement the `parse` method to loop over product elements, yield dictionaries of extracted data.
   - Add pagination support by finding the “next page” button, extracting its link, and recursively following it with a callback to `parse`.

4. **Running the Spider:**
   - Run the spider from the project folder using `scrapy crawl whiskey`.
   - Output results directly to a JSON or CSV file using Scrapy’s built-in export options (`-o`).
   - Notes about Scrapy managing request delays automatically via settings, avoiding the need for manual sleep calls.

5. **Results:**
   - Successfully scrape all 746 products over multiple pages.
   - JSON or CSV file contains all product data.
   - Scrapy provides detailed logging of item counts and request statistics.

The tutorial emphasizes Scrapy’s ease of use compared to other scraping methods and suggests learning Linux command line basics and intermediate Python concepts (like classes) to effectively use Scrapy.

  2. Chrome Web Scraper Extension [(Video)](https://youtu.be/aClnnoQK9G0
<youtube_summary>In this video tutorial, Ashore Rafi demonstrates how to scrape data automatically from multiple web pages using a free Google Chrome extension called Web Scraper. The example used is extracting car insurance service providers' information from the Yellow Pages business directory for New York City and state. The data collected includes business or personal profiles' name, phone number, address, website, and email.

Key steps covered:

1. **Extension Installation:** Install the Web Scraper extension from the Chrome Web Store.

2. **Setting Up Sitemap:** Create a new sitemap named "yellow page extraction" with the start URL being the search results page.

3. **Selecting Data Elements:**
   - Select all business listing links on the page as the first selector (type: link, multiple).
   - Within each business listing, add selectors for business name (text), phone number (text), address (text), website (link), and email (link).
   - Select pagination links (pages) to enable scraping across multiple pages automatically.

4. **Configuring Parent Selectors:** Set parent selectors for the link selector to include both the root and pages selectors to allow navigation through pages and listings.

5. **Scraping Settings:** Set a delay interval (e.g., 2000 milliseconds) between page visits to avoid website restrictions.

6. **Running the Scraper:** Start the scraping process, which visits each listing on all pages and collects the specified data fields. Some listings may have missing data fields if the information is not provided.

7. **Exporting Data:** After scraping, export the collected data as a CSV file and open it in Excel.

8. **Data Cleaning:** Clean the data by removing unnecessary text such as "mailto:" from email addresses using Excel's find and replace feature. Duplicate websites are explained due to multiple contacts listed under the same business.

The tutorial emphasizes that this method can be used for any business directory or website to extract structured data efficiently. The video encourages viewers to like, share, comment with questions, and subscribe for more tutorials.</youtube_summary>

## Smart Narratives with Power BI

[![Smart narratives with Power BI](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/eHmvCNhZiWg/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/eHmvCNhZiWg
<youtube_summary>This session introduces Microsoft Power BI, a tool for data visualization and insight generation. The demonstration begins by importing data from an Excel sheet containing cities and their populations, previously used in the course. Once loaded, the data is divided into three sections: the visualization area (where graphs appear), filters (to refine data), and fields (data columns).

By selecting fields like city and UN 2018 population metrics, Power BI automatically generates bar charts. Filters allow users to exclude or include specific data points, such as removing Tokyo, which updates the visualization in real-time. A key feature highlighted is the automated summary or narrative generation: by right-clicking a graph and selecting "summarize," Power BI provides insights like identifying Tokyo as having the highest population and Guadalajara the lowest.

Users can also add custom metrics or ask questions interactively, similar to a chatbot, to retrieve information such as the total count of cities or the city with the highest population. These summaries update dynamically when data changes, such as removing Tokyo from the dataset, which then shifts the highest population insight to Delhi.

Additionally, multiple graph types can be created, including location-based visualizations plotting countries and cities geographically. Overall, Power BI offers easy, automatic graph generation, dynamic filtering, narrative summaries, and user-driven customization, making data analysis interactive and insightful.</youtube_summary>
