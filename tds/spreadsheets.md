## Spreadsheet: Excel, Google Sheets

You'll use spreadsheets for data cleaning and exploration. The most popular spreadsheet program is [Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel) followed by [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/).

You may be already familiar with these. If not, make sure to learn the basics of both.

<youtube_summary>Kevin provides a comprehensive beginner-to-advanced tutorial on using Google Sheets, a free spreadsheet tool for data analysis and collaboration. The tutorial covers:

1. Accessing Google Sheets via Google.com, sheets.google.com, Google Drive, or sheets.new, and creating new spreadsheets or using templates.
2. Basic spreadsheet navigation, including understanding cells, columns, rows, zoom, naming files, saving, and offline access.
3. Entering and formatting data, using features like smart fill to auto-complete data series, formatting numbers, adjusting column widths, hiding/showing columns, freezing rows, and rearranging columns.
4. Using conditional formatting and alternating colors to visually enhance tables and highlight data trends.
5. Calculating sums and percentages using both direct formulas and functions, including absolute and relative cell references with dollar signs and named ranges for easier formula management.
6. Performing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with cell references.
7. Utilizing the VLOOKUP function to search for values in tables and return corresponding data dynamically.
8. Managing multiple sheets within a workbook, renaming, reordering, and referencing data across sheets.
9. Sorting and filtering data with filters and saved filter views to quickly access specific data subsets.
10. Creating and customizing charts (column, line, 3D charts) that update automatically with data changes, including adding trendlines.
11. Using pivot tables for drag-and-drop data summarization, aggregation (sum, average, max, min), filtering, and percentage calculations, simplifying complex analysis without formulas.
12. Collecting data via Google Forms linked directly to Sheets for real-time response tracking.
13. Sharing spreadsheets with specific people or via link, setting permissions (view, comment, edit), and collaborating in real-time with visible user cursors, chat, and comments.
14. Inserting comments with @mentions and assigning tasks to collaborators, managing comment threads, and marking them complete.
15. Viewing version history to track changes and revert to previous versions if needed, including naming versions for clarity.
16. Additional sharing options like publishing to the web, emailing, downloading as Excel, and printing with customizable settings.
