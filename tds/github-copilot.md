## AI Editor: GitHub Copilot

AI Code Editors like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), [Windsurf](http://windsurf.com/), [Roo Code](https://roocode.com/), [Cline](https://cline.bot/), [Continue.dev](https://www.continue.dev/), etc. use LLMs to help you write code faster.

Most are built on top of [VS Code](vscode.md). These are now a standard tool in every developer's toolkit.

[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) is [free](https://github.com/features/copilot/plans) (as of May 2025) for 2,000 completions and 50 chats.

<youtube_summary>This guide introduces GitHub Copilot, an AI pair programmer designed to help write code faster across many programming languages and editors, including Visual Studio Code, JetBrains IDEs, Neovim, Xcode, GitHub mobile, terminals, and github.com. It offers more than code completion by assisting with natural language coding, shell commands, pull request descriptions, debugging, and more.

To use GitHub Copilot, you need a GitHub account and a Copilot license, available in four tiers: free, Copilot Pro for individuals, business, and enterprise licenses. Students, educators, and popular open source maintainers can access Copilot Pro for free via GitHub Education. Users are encouraged to try the free tier first.

Installation varies by editor:
- In VS Code, install the GitHub Copilot extension and the companion Copilot Chat from the Marketplace, then sign in and authorize through GitHub.
- In JetBrains IDEs like PyCharm, install GitHub Copilot from the plugins Marketplace, restart the IDE, then sign in and authorize similarly, including authorizing Copilot Chat for conversational help.

Once installed, Copilot suggests code inline as you type, providing multiple completion options accessible by tab or enter keys. Copilot Chat offers explanations of code and can modify or improve code based on user queries, applying changes directly in the editor.

GitHub Copilot is unique because it integrates seamlessly where developers work—within their editors and GitHub—eliminating context switching. It is specifically tailored for programming compared to other AI copilots.

The guide concludes by inviting users to ask questions in the comments or GitHub Community, to read the accompanying blog post, and to subscribe for future episodes covering essential Copilot features, encouraging users to sign up and start coding with GitHub Copilot.</youtube_summary>
