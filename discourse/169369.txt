Response 3: Hi @carlton @Jivraj sir, I wanted to bring to your attention that, although as you are already aware that I was present for the ROE and successfully submitted my exam, my dashboard currently reflects my status as “Absent.” I have attached a screenshot for your reference. I assume this might be a backend issue or that the scores are still being updated. Could you kindly look into this and confirm? Thank you 1000032712 1080×1032 90.3 KB
