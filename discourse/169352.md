![The image shows a webpage titled "TDS 2025 Jan ROE" with instructions for a quiz or exam. It includes guidelines on how to approach the questions, such as reading material, choosing questions randomly, and using multiple attempts. There's a section for a bonus mark and links for additional resources like Discord and Google Meet for students. The page also shows a login status and recent saves with scores. The header indicates that the session ended on a specific date and time.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/b/8/b8bcbf8009364152380ffbd0508ead5cc0700c2c_2_690x431.png)

Post 2: Did you submit before 1:47? If yes, then your highest score will be taken. If not then, you will be marked absent.
