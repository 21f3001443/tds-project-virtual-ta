Response 5: Hi @carlton , I was working on GA7 as part of Task 4 in 7.1. In task 4.Sheet1, the columns include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value. While I could extract Series ID and Item, I couldn’t locate Year, Month, or Value in the dataset. Could someone please assist me with this? image 1393×657 67.8 KB

Image explanation: The image is a screenshot of a spreadsheet containing data related to the PPI (Producer Price Index) industry, specifically for pharmaceutical preparations. There are two sets of data:

1.  **Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations:** This section details the series title, series ID (PCU3254123254127111), seasonality (Not Seasonally Adjusted), survey name (PPI Industry Data), measure data (Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations), industry (Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing), and item (Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations).
2.  **Calcium channel blockers:**  Similar to the first section, this section presents data for Calcium channel blockers, including series title, series ID (PCU3254123254127114), seasonality (Not Seasonally Adjusted), survey name (PPI Industry Data), measure data (Calcium channel blockers), industry (Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing), and item (Calcium channel blockers).
Response 6: There is another dataset provided for the other records.

Response 7: image 1227×791 78.2 KB Monthly Price Indices file have those columns.

Image explanation: The image contains instructions for a task related to analyzing the impact of pharmaceutical exports on India's economy. The task involves creating a Google Sheet, importing data from provided CSV files ("Industry Product Segment Information" and "Monthly Price Indices for Segments"), and creating a pivot table.  The instructions specify the naming conventions for the Google Sheet, sharing permissions, sheet names, and the required structure for the pivot table (rows, columns, and values).

Response 8: @ Jivraj In the GA 7.1 part it is said that we need data of which columns are but the dataset provided has no column named “Item”

Image explanation: The image contains the text "4. Sheet1: Columns include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value.". It appears to describe the structure of a spreadsheet named "Sheet1" and lists the column headers included within it.

Image explanation: The image shows a table with data in columns labeled "Series ID", "Year", "Period", "Label", and "Value". The first row of data contains the following values: "PCU3254-3254-" in the "Series ID" column, "2023" in the "Year" column, "M01" in the "Period" column, "2023 Jan" in the "Label" column, and "562.445" in the "Value" column.

Response 9: Thanks a lot for pointing out and sorry it’s my bad missed it.

Response 10: Item is there in other sheet we might have to join them to get items.

Response 11: We have to extract all id’s and their respective item from other sheet and add in first sheet with respect to id’s .

Response 12: @carlton Sir I don’t have Microsoft PowerPoint. What should I do ?

Response 13: Use the free version on Microsoft 365

Response 14: Below items don’t have prices. PCU3254123254127111 Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations PCU3254123254127114 Calcium channel blockers PCU325412325412MM Miscellaneous receipts PCU325412325412D112OC Other digestive or genito-urinary preparations, over-the-counter PCU325412325412D113 Antacids PCU325412325412SS Secondary products PCU3254123254127112 ACE inhibitors Some items don’t have prices for all 24 months. Although the assignment says 24 months (I assumed 2023 January to 2024 December) data, many items have prices for 2025 Jan as well. Monthly Price Indices for Segments (Two-year data) Shall I delete the records for which price is not available? image 1290×648 53.1 KB @carlton @Jivraj
