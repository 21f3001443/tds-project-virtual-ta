Post 1: Hello, My grades are updated in my dashboard, but my bonus marks are not given, I got bonus marks two times, one was the app design using GPT and another one was student feedback to Project 1. Please look into that. @Jivraj @carlton

It also displays average assignment scores for end-term eligibility and final scoring, programming quiz scores, course project scores, and the end-term exam score. The total course score and letter grade are provided, with a final grade of "A."

Post 6: Hi Rajat, If you add up all your score, it comes to 78.6. Your final score was 83. So the additional boost comes from the bonus. I will check with @jkmadathil why the bonus is not explicitly visible. Kind regards
