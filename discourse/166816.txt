**Main Content Area:**

    *   Cookie blocking
    *   Javascript being required
    *   Using Chrome Browser

    *   Aggressive anti-virus software

*   **Assignment Link:**  A link to the assignment: https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga2.

In short, it appears to be the interface for a specific graded assignment within a course, indicating that the due date has passed but access might still be possible.

Image explanation: The image shows a webpage interface for an online course or assessment platform. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Top:** A red bar indicates the assessment has ended ("Ended at Sun, 2 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST"). It also displays the score, "Score: 0", and buttons for "Check all" and "Save".
*   **Middle:** There's a section for questions and discussion ("Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse"). The user is logged in as "23f3000975@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" with a "Logout" option. Handwritten annotations say "week 2".
*   **Bottom:** A green section displays "Recent saves" with reload options, timestamps, and scores (all 6.5).

Essentially, the image captures a snapshot of a user's status and activity within a course or assessment platform after the deadline has passed.
Image explanation: The image shows a learning platform interface, specifically a page for "Graded Assignment 4" within a course titled "Jan 2025-TDS" from IIT Madras.  The due date for the assignment has passed. There are instructions regarding troubleshooting access to the assignment, including advice on disabling ad blockers, enabling cookies and JavaScript, using Chrome, disabling interfering browser extensions, and checking anti-virus software and network policies. It also instructs the user to use their student ID for the assignment. A link to the graded assignment is provided. The side navigation shows course modules.

Image explanation: The image shows a screen capture of a webpage, likely related to an online course or assignment.  Here's a breakdown of the information displayed:

*   **Course/Assignment Information:** The page is likely for a graded assignment. It mentions bonus marks for posting on the "GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]" on Discourse, indicating it's part of an IITM BS (likely a Bachelor of Science program at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras) course. A relevant question or reply on the forum earns a bonus mark.
*   **User Login:** The image states "You are logged in as 23f3000975@ds.study.iitm.ac.in." and provides a logout link.

Overall, the screenshot is a user's view of an assignment page, including details about bonus marks, login information, previous saves, and the deadline/score.

Response 1: Could you send me your email id. thanks.

Response 4: @24ds3000061 @22f2001532 Can you check the dashboard now, I’ve been informed by operations that the scores have been pushed. GA 4 scores will be a little late to be pushed because there are some manual (i.e. automated using a custom written script) corrections that have to be made to Q4 for students who got Nur-Sultan as their city. Kind regards

Response 5: Thanks Carlton. Now the results are visible in the dashboard. Thanks REVI
