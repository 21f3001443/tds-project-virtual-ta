Post 5: Asking help is different from sharing answers in a public forum. I don’t think they will permit this.

Post 7: If the ROE is like how it was for MOCK ROE1 then this probably wont work right? Only for today’s ROE(mock 2) we can split  the tasks efficiently and get it done. Thoughts?

Post 10: What's the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam? Tools in Data Science @ankit.jain – I’m the culprit behind this RoE structure. Thanks for the opportunity to share my thought process. 
What does this RoE evaluate? Implicit learning. 

Implicit learning is “How much can they answer if woken up from sleep?”
Explicit learning is “How much can they answer given time and Internet?”

Some may know 10% implicitly. Some know 50%. They’ll answer those in a few seconds. 
Some, they can FIND out. with Google, StackOverflow, ChatGPT. That’s explicit learning. But it takes time…

Post 11: Their whole concept of implicit learning disappears when people start sharing answers in a public forum.
