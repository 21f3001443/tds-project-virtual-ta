Response 1: Sir @s.anand @carlton even the final score is released and grade is visible but not change is made in the PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1 status yet. I got 70% score in that but it is showing absent instead. It affected my grade severely sir , I would’ve gotten A grade according to that but because the PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1 score is not calculated it is showing C grade. Please help me with this issue sir , I will be really grateful . Again a recent screenshot of TDS dashboard view . image 496×630 38.5 KB Thanking you

Image explanation: The image shows a course grade report for "Tools in Data Science". The report includes assignment scores for each week, average assignment scores, scores for programming quiz, course project, end-term exam, total course score, and course grade letter. It also indicates whether the student is allowed to take the end-term exam, which is "Yes".

Response 2: I have confirmed your marks and informed Operations who will make the appropriate ammendments. Kind regards and Happy New Year
