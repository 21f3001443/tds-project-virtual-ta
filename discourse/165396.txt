Question: Hello, I submitted my graded assignment for TDS course. But unfortunately I did not see the question in the portal asking if I have seen all questions and attended the exam. Can someone please clarify if it shall be graded still? @carlton @Jivraj image 1340×527 17.9 KB image 1002×560 51.4 KB

Image explanation: The image is a screenshot of a webpage, likely an online assessment or learning platform, showing the user's login status, a discussion forum link, and a record of recent saves or attempts. 

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Top Red Bar:** Indicates the assignment or quiz has ended ("Ended at Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST").
*   **Light Blue Section:** Promotes a discussion forum ("Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse").
*   **Login Information:** Shows the user is logged in with a specific ID and email address ("You are logged in as 22ds1000103@ds.study.iitm.ac.in.") and a "Logout" button.

Image explanation: The image shows a graded assignment, with the due date already passed. It provides instructions for accessing the assignment, including disabling ad blockers, allowing cookies, enabling JavaScript, using Chrome browser, disabling browser extensions, and avoiding overly aggressive anti-virus software. It also emphasizes the importance of using the correct student ID.

The assignment includes a question: "I have seen the Graded Assignment 1 available at this link and have attempted it." The student answered "No," but this is incorrect. The correct answer, as indicated, is "Yes". The student received a score of 0 for this question.

Response 1: @Muthupalaniappan It is saying you did not attempt it because you did not answer the seek portal question. You are not graded on the seek portal question. It only exists to make sure you saw the GA and attempted it. You are only graded on your submission of GA1 on the actual assignment page where your last saved submission is used for grading. Kind regards

Response 2: Dear Sir, I encountered the same issue as mentioned. Could you please confirm whether GA 1 will still be evaluated under this condition, and if we will receive our actual score based on the last saved submission on the assignment page?

Response 3: sir can you please allow us to submit it . like open the seek portal for a few mins . because we have worked hard to finished the assignment and all our hardwork will be in vain … please

Response 5: Hello, I accessed the assignment through the provided link and attempted and saved it. But unfortunately I forgot to submit it on my course LMS. I have put in a lot of effort to complete this and I scored 9,  so I kindly request you to consider it and provide your clarification on the matter.

Response 6: Respected Sir, I made the similar mistake of not selecting a yes on the seek IITM portal According to your previous replies, does it imply that only the answers submitted through the link provided will be considered for evaluation regardless of the seek portal selection for this time? Thanks

Response 7: @23f2005471 Correct! Only scores that were saved in your actual last submission on the ga page itself will be evaluated (the portal question is just to make sure you were aware of the GA and confirm that you attempted it). Kind regards

Response 8: Respected Sir/Madam, I have submitted the TDS GA 1 assignment but failed to submit the Yes or NO option in the checkbox I request you to please consider my submission as I have scored 6/10 marks in the assignment and if you won’t my whole efforts will be lost just because of this image 1463×795 64.3 KB

Image explanation: Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall:**

*   It's a screenshot of what appears to be an online coding/SQL assessment or exercise.

**Key Elements:**

*   **Header:**
    *   URL: "exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-gal" (suggests an online exam platform)
    *   Due Date/Time: "Due Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST"
    *   Score: "Score: 10/10"
    *   Buttons: "Check" and "Save"
*   **SQL Query Box:**
    *   The following SQL query:

    ```sql
    FROM tickets
    WHERE LOWER(TRIM(type)) = 'gold';
    ```
*   **Problem Description:**

    *   "Get all rows where the Type is "Gold". Ignore spaces and treat mis-spellings like GOLD, gold, etc. as "Gold". Calculate the sales as Units"
*   **Feedback:**
    *   "Correct" (indicating the query is correct)
*   **Submission Status:**

    *   "Submitted"
    *   Warning that resubmitting will overwrite the previous submission and score
*   **Footer:**

    *   "Save regularly. Your last saved submission will be evaluated."

**Interpretation:**

The user was tasked with writing an SQL query to retrieve rows from a table named "tickets" where the "type" column contains variations of "Gold". The "LOWER(TRIM(type))" part of the query ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive and that any leading/trailing spaces in the "type" column are removed before comparison.

The user successfully wrote the correct query and has achieved a perfect score.
