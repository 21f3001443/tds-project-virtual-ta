Question: The lectures primarily focus on surface-level explanations without ensuring a strong foundational understanding of the topics. Key concepts, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and related technologies, are not explained in a structured manner, making it difficult for students to follow.

Response 1: @carlton sir i watch live session recording , but still not getting some useful from it , I am talking about week 3 content in llm , these words are never heard by us so please try to tech from basic things please . At least tell us , what is llm and what is use of , everything is going to above of our head .

Response 2: Hi Hari, The goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended. Have you watched this session in particular? If thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it followed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases But of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student. Ultimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding. Kind regards

Image explanation: The image contains the text "Week 3 Session 1" overlayed on a colorful background with various illustrated icons.
Image explanation: Here's a breakdown of what I see in the image:

*   **A video conferencing window:** This is indicated by the presence of "Meet - odh-ycbm-ahj" in the browser tab, suggesting Google Meet. The right side of the image shows the video conference with Amit Kumar Gupta.

*   **A web browser (Opera likely):** The interface appears to be that of the Opera browser. It displays several tabs, and the search bar is visible.

*   **Browser homepage/speed dial:** The browser window shows several website icons or 'speed dial' icons on the homepage. The background image is orange and includes the Naruto anime character.

*   **Website shortcuts (Speed Dial Icons):**

    *   "Amit" (Likely a personal link).
    *   "DS Discourse" (Likely a data science-related discussion forum).
    *   "App Dev II Project Doc..." (Application Development project document).
    *   "(159) Tools in Data Scie..." (Tools for Data Science).
    *   "Java Tutorial | Learn Jav..." (Java programming tutorial).
    *   "Prime Number Progra..." (Probably a coding exercise or tutorial related to prime numbers).
    *   "PDSA" (Possibly related to problem-solving or project management).
    *   "tds june 2024" (Likely a folder or resource with content from June 2024).
    *   "MAD-2 resources" (Likely resources or material related to a subject with code MAD-2).

*   **Windows taskbar:** Visible at the bottom of the screen, showing icons for applications, system tray, and date/time (July 11, 2024, 20:14 or 8:14 PM).

Image explanation: The image shows a screen capture of a presentation or online course related to data sourcing.

Here's a breakdown of what's visible:

*   **Course Website:** The main part of the image shows a course website, likely hosted by IIT Madras (Indian Institute of Technology Madras). The course is titled "Data Sourcing."
*   **Course Content:** The content on the page includes:

    *   A title: "Data Sourcing".
    *   A rating (5/5 with 2 reviews).
    *   Points about "Control Extraction Area" and "Save Extracted Data."
    *   A list of links and references, including a notebook on "PDF Scraping" and resources for "tabula" and "pandas" packages.
    *   The section "Optional: Real-life scraping," which describes a live scraping session involving data from emarketer.com.
*   **Sidebar Navigation:** A sidebar on the left shows course modules: "Course Introduction," "Self Assessment," "1. Data Discovery," "2. Data Sourcing," "3. Data Preparation," "4. Data Analysis," "5. Large Language Models," and "Project 1 & 2".
*   **Video Call/Presentation:** On the right side of the image, there's a smaller screen that appears to be a video call or presentation with a participant named Carlton D'Silva.

In short, the image captures a lesson or module about data sourcing within an IIT Madras online course, including resources, practical examples of web scraping, and a live video call component.
