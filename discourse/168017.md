![The image shows a webpage titled "TDS 2025 Jan GA5 - Data Preparation." It includes instructions for a task or assessment related to data preparation. The instructions emphasize learning, checking answers, saving work, and using resources. There's a section for recent saves with timestamps and scores, and a note about the task ending on a specific date and time. There's also a link for joining a discussion on Discourse and a logout option.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/e/9/e9585e072dfc3561e03c611c02e5b5e283f3f1be_2_690x448.png)

Post 2: This is nothing to worry about because as you can see in the Recent saves section, it has your score history. We have your entire submission history because we log that. Kind regards
