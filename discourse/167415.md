Post 1: @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini I got a mail saying my Dockerfile is missing. However I have a dockerfile already in my github repository. Is it an issue with the spelling of dockerfile since I have submitted it in all small case as ‘dockerfile’. It was showing the score when I checked with the evaluate.py that was provided by iitm. Shall I just change the name of the file from ‘dockerfile’ to ‘Dockerfile’ in github repository of mine or is there anything else that is needed to detect the Dockerfile?

Post 2: The name of the Dockerfile should be “Dockerfile” indeed, more over check other sections of your submission like Is the GitHub repo public? Does it have an MIT license? Does it have a DockerFile? Is the Docker image accessible?

Post 3: Oh ok made the changes in Github. I hope submitting again is not required since the links and names are same.

Post 4: Sir, i got this mail. I have checked that the repo is public and already has a Dockerfile. I have renamed the ‘LICENSE’ file as ‘MIT LICENSE’.

Post 6: Sir, please consider it we have spent a lot of time, in my case just the d in Dockerfile was small that too on remote repository. On my local repository it was Dockerfile only I even have a published docker image as verified by you autated script only. The name of the file on remote repository did not change even after commit it through my local repo, once I read the mail in morning it was only then I realised it wasn’t changed on GitHub repo. Sir I understand the deadline has passed and I am not asking for a resubmission, I am just asking to consider the already submitted work, just that. It would be really helpful. I just have one commit on my repo that too “Rename dockerfile to Dokerfile” . Sir please attest consider what we have already submitted. I have made no changes as you can verify it too. Sir it is a humble request to please consider it. Warm Regards, Satvik Sawhney 23f2003680 Screenshot 2025-02-18 at 1.53.10 PM 1889×467 54 KB
![The image shows a list of files and directories in a repository, likely from a version control platform like GitHub. It includes:

- Directories: "Business" and "Operations," both reconfigured a few days ago.
- A directory named "app" with an updated Dockerfile and requirements.txt.
- A "Dockerfile" that was renamed recently.
- A "LICENSE" file with an MIT License.
- A "README.md" file with a note about the project structure.

Each entry includes a brief description and a timestamp indicating when the last change was made.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/1/a/1a5f2ea044383efcb5d248ddb487665e9e65957d_2_690x170.png)
