Response 1: 

Response 2: image 1296×158 7.29 KB For question 16 of GA1, It says "Rename all files replacing each digit with the next " Accepted answer is working only if file names are renamed as 2h3q9x.txt → 3h4q0x.txt eb209nmlca.txt → eb310nmlca.txt That means if digit is 9 then next digit should be 0. @carlton @Jivraj let me know if this is what is expected. since 9->10 or 209 → 210 is not working

Response 3: Hi anant, Question mentions every digit should be replaced by next one. In that case 209 would get replaced by 310

Response 4: Hello Sir, When I am following that logic to rename files, assessment check is giving error “Incorrect. Try again.”

Response 5: @21f2000370 Since you have managed to get all the answers correct, I presume there are no further issues w/ Q16.

Response 6: Hi, I am unable to access Graded Assignment 1. Every time I click on the given link, all I can see is this page. Please advise. tdsga1 1902×919 31.1 KB

Response 8: As I highlighted earlier, Its not accepting the answer  if I follow correct logic for renaming for example 209->210, but it is accepting if rename as 209->310

Response 9: Hi Anant, 21f2000370: image 1296×158 7.29 KB Here in question, it’s mentioned to replace every digit with next digit, that’s why 209 would be 310.

Response 10: In attempting the third question, I’m unable to download the npm package as it requires docker. When trying to install docker from the installer, it freezes in the verifying package stage. Can somebody please help solve my problem? @carlton @Jivraj

Response 11: image 1627×202 12.6 KB Which HTML content we want to take?

Image explanation: This image contains a prompt for a coding challenge. The challenge asks the user to use CSS selectors to find all `<div>` elements with the class "foo" within a hidden HTML element, and then calculate the sum of their `data-value` attributes. The image also has a space for the user to input the answer.

Response 12: Hi Suhani, npm does not require docker. Kind regards

Response 13: Hi Hisham, Its described in the question. There is a hidden element hiding somewhere after that question. You would have to inspect the DOM to find it.

Response 15: Hello Sir. I am unable to install uv in my windows system. Whenever I run the code provided at the reference link in Powershell, my anti-virus system sends a message that it was blocked. Even after blocking Real-time security, uv does not display. What am I doing wrong?

Response 16: Hi, I’m unable to view assignments. below is the screenshot for your reference. Screenshot 2025-01-12 150511 963×632 14.5 KB Please suggest me a way to view it. I have allowed third-party cookies as well. Thanks

Image explanation: The image shows an error message indicating that a website cannot be reached. The specific message is "This site can't be reached" and it states that "exam.sanand.workers.dev unexpectedly closed the connection." The image suggests trying the following:

*   Checking the connection
*   Checking the proxy and the firewall
*   Running Windows Network Diagnostics

The error code is ERR\_CONNECTION\_CLOSED. There are also "Reload" and "Details" buttons visible.

Response 17: Hi manmeet, I don’t know about solution to this. Some network setting might be causing problem. Alternatively you can make use of GitHub codespaces which provides 120 hours of free run time in a month. With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains. I have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection.

Response 18: Hi samra, Try installing some other browser see if that works.

Response 19: Hi mishkat, Without sharing code, can you pls share your approach how you are trying to solve this question.
