Response 9: reading this at 12:01 after submitting A1 to A7 .  okay sleeping now. lets see if what i can finish tomorrow.

Response 10: yes Ayush, you mentioned about your heart and liver problems. its necessary that your heart feels good (just kidding bro )

Response 11: It is good that the practical elements are core in the course though more time should be given for balanced approach between projects and graded assignments. There were some issues I faced. For example, the GitHub link of the datagen.py was incorrect and I was confused due to the code not generating the expected outcome. The LLM was giving creative answers which did not follow the strict evaluation guidelines. So, the case was not passed. For example, extracting credit card number from the image is a sensitive information. I am alright with it since the evaluation will be different. Now, I am really well versed with the tools taught in these weeks. Thanking the whole TDS Team for this project which was very well designed.

Response 12: A post was split to a new topic: Just some background test
