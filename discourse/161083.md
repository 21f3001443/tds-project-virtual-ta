Post 3: image 1296×158 7.29 KB For question 16 of GA1, It says "Rename all files replacing each digit with the next " Accepted answer is working only if file names are renamed as 2h3q9x.txt → 3h4q0x.txt eb209nmlca.txt → eb310nmlca.txt That means if digit is 9 then next digit should be 0. @carlton @Jivraj let me know if this is what is expected. since 9->10 or 209 → 210 is not working
![The image shows a task description for moving and renaming files as part of an assignment or exercise. It instructs the user to:

1. Download and extract a file named `q-move-rename-files.zip`.
2. Use the `mv` command to move all files from subdirectories into an empty folder.
3. Rename all files by replacing each digit in the filenames with the next digit (e.g., `a19b.txt` becomes `a20b.txt`).

Additionally, it asks what the output of running the command `grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` in bash within that folder would show.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/f/8/f8af7c6e2fe001c8bf000605b52c903e1b0e6fe1.png)

Post 4: Hi anant, Question mentions every digit should be replaced by next one. In that case 209 would get replaced by 310

Post 23: Hi manmeet, I don’t know about solution to this. Some network setting might be causing problem. Alternatively you can make use of GitHub codespaces which provides 120 hours of free run time in a month. With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains. I have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection.

Post 27: 2 days ago I  attempted TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Development Tools and scored 8.5. I didn’t submit as I wanted to attempt incorrect answer questions. When I logged in today it says score is 0. Shall I submit or not? Do I have to attempt all questions again? Why the assignment and submissions are two separate pages/links? If [seek] ( Nptel Seekh ) can access [TDS exam] ( Technical Assessment ) then why we need to submit from seek?
[View on Discourse](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga1-development-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161083/27)


Post 28: The seek portal question is to confirm that the student has seen the GA. It does not actually give you a score. Otherwise students sometimes claim that they looked and did not find any GAs (this has happened in the past). Hence the two stage verification. You still need to the submissions to get a score for the GA. The actual GA questions are on https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/ via the seek portal or on the Tools in Data Science introduction page. Its just a more robust way of ensuring that students have indeed viewed the GAs. As far your submission goes, we have your last submission and the score. We will check on our end why your submission has not reloaded into your browser. Normally these are stored in session storage. So if your browser has deleted them, it might have not loaded from our back end server. @s.anand will be able to confirm the reason for this problem. For the time being if you are making a fresh submission, just fill in all the answers in again, so that your latest submission will be marked correctly. Kind regards

My question is whether I need to submit on seek to save answers on Exam? (I checked my score and saved it on the exam site.)

Post 30: Hi @Nelson Your answers on the exam site that have been submitted will be saved and used as the basis for your score. Saying yes/no on seek does not materially impact scoring. Its just an awareness question. Even if you answered yes on the seek portal, you can still revise your answers on the exam site. The final submission is always whats locked in for the score (until the deadline passes). Kind regards

Since the data for each student is dynamically generated and unique, the answer you submitted seems inconsistent with your dataset. We encourage collaboration among students, but copying answers is not acceptable. Instead, I suggest reaching out to your friend to understand the script they used, run it on your dataset, and ensure you fully grasp the solution. kind regards
