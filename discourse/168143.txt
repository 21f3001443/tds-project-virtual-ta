Question: my score from week 2 to week 5 are still showing not submitted. Screenshot 2025-02-22 181257 1144Ã—704 30.8 KB

Image explanation: The image shows a course dashboard with different modules and assignments.

Here's a breakdown of what's visible:

*   **Module 1: Development Tools**
*   **Module 2: Deployment Tools:** This module is expanded to show an assignment, "Graded Assignment 2". It indicates the due date (2 Feb 2025) and that the assignment has not been submitted. It also has columns for "Your Score", "Peer Average", and "Median Score", but they are currently empty.
*   **Module 3: Large Language Models**
*   **Project 1**
*   **Module 4: Data Sourcing**
*   **Module 5: Data Preparation**
Response 1: @23f1000879 This is not the screen where you see your scores for Tools in Data Science. Its only shown on dashboard. Can you send a screenshot of your dashboard. Thanks Kind regards
