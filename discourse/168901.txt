Image explanation: The image shows a source control graph, likely from a Git repository visualization tool. It displays a history of commits and merges, including information about branches, pull requests, and commit messages.  The graph also shows several actions in relation to the LLM, as well as a link to base64guru.
Response 4: Failure is part of life. My laptop hanged and despite having all the needed resources I panicked and the exam went the way it went. I take this as a lesson. This resource will be refined further. I thank everyone involved. I am glad that many benefitted and were actually able to score well.
