Post 5: @24ds3000061 @22f2001532 Can you check the dashboard now, I’ve been informed by operations that the scores have been pushed. GA 4 scores will be a little late to be pushed because there are some manual (i.e. automated using a custom written script) corrections that have to be made to Q4 for students who got Nur-Sultan as their city.

Post 71: @23f2004320 I have checked the backend server. The actual score is 85 in Module 1. Ignore seek portal, because scores are evaluated externally on our server. Those scores on seek portal are just from the placeholder question that asked whether you saw GA1 and attempted it. It has no bearing on your actual marks. The actual score will be in the dashboard soon. Kind regards.
