Post 7: Hi @carlton , I was working on GA7 as part of Task 4 in 7.1. In task 4.Sheet1, the columns include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value. While I could extract Series ID and Item, I couldn’t locate Year, Month, or Value in the dataset. Could someone please assist me with this? image 1393×657 67.8 KB

Post 20: @carlton Can you please advise regarding the ga.7.2 as the The current top 5 countries by GDP in 2014 from the dataset are actually aggregated economic groups (not individual countries). can i proceed with that or I need to filter only the individual countries

Post 25: The question asked for top 5 countries. So that would be the approach for this question, not aggregated economic groups.

Post 26: Hi @carlton sir, I have received the bonus marks email with 5 additional HTML files for peer review. However, I noticed that one of these files was also included in the initial peer grading email. Could you please clarify if I should fill out the peer review form for this particular file again, or should I skip it since it has already been graded? 1000041565 1280×349 87.7 KB

Post 28: Sir, In case we are not provided access to view their respective sheets, we would have no option but to either leave the column blank or mark it as 0. However, if others have marked it differently based on their available information, there is a possibility that our responses may vary — potentially exceeding the permissible variance limit of ±33%. In such a scenario, would this mean we would not be eligible for the bonus? Additionally, it would be really helpful if a uniform approach or standard marking could be communicated for such cases where access is not granted. This would ensure consistency across all submissions and avoid discrepancies arising from random or subjective entries, which seems to be happening currently.

Post 29: If you are not provided access, contact the peer. Their email is there in the html file. It’s in the peers interest and yours. That’s an important aspect of GA7, it’s to get people to work together and collaborate. Peer reviews like the real world is going to be messy. The way to reduce the messiness is to communicate with one another.

Post 30: @carlton sir can you please clarify what do we have to write in google form if there is no submission?

Post 31: You have two options. Get in touch with the peer (you have their email address), this is the recommended approach. Or you could give them zero because you were not able to evaluate their submission.
