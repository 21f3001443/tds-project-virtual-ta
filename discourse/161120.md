Post 21: @22f2001640 in that case a firewall or local security settings might block access to port 8080, or a network restriction is blocking access to port 8080 Please try one of these: Try the same on a personal laptop on a public / home network GitHub codespaces, as @Jivraj suggested You could try an ngrok alternative like localtunnel but I don’t think that’ll work.

1. **Terminal Window**:

   - The output shows JSON responses with student IDs and class information.

2. **Web Browser**:
   - Two tabs are visible. One tab shows an assignment or project page related to an API, with instructions and expected outputs.
   - The page provides guidance on handling query parameters for class filtering and mentions enabling CORS.

3. **Code Editor or Another Terminal**:
   - Displays JSON data, possibly as part of debugging or testing the API responses.

4. **Desktop Environment**:
   - The screen is from a macOS system, as indicated by the dock and menu bar at the top.

The overall context suggests work related to developing or testing a web API, likely for a class or assignment.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/e/1/e1b4ee743ca378af275b6073cdb40da390235eba_2_690x431.png)

Post 29: Hi Mishkat, In your code, the word class is a reserved keyword in python. So simply changing class_ to class is not going to work. The only thing you need to change is the keyword accepted by the api not the variable name used inside your function. Hope that helps you narrow down the problem. Kind regards

Post 46: @23f2003751 While I understand why you might choose to use flask due to your familiarity with it, the http.server library is just very simple to use. The only extra line of code you would need inside your get request if you used the http.server library would be: self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*") Try to rewrite your code using http.server library so that your debugging for simple tasks like this is easy. The boilerplate code for a get request using the http.server library was already given in Q6. So you have to do very minimal modifications to it and it works like a charm. Kind regards

Post 48: @23F300327 You would have to be a bit more specific on what exactly is the nature of your error on your machine. GA2 - Q6 has no dependency on the OS or your computer. It uses Github (an online platform), it uses Vercel (an online platform) and thats it. I have a macbook air and it works fine for GA2 - Q6. Since the code you are running has no such dependency on your local machine it should not have problems. Now typical problems for example Q6 (and other questions) might involve the use of CORS. So for example the url might work in your browser when you access the vercel deployment url directly, but when using it via the GA, the request triggers a CORS error, because a third party application is requesting rather than you directly. Also the live sessions on youtube will address some of these deployment related issues that students are facing. There will be session 2025-01-20T14:30:00Z → 2025-01-20T16:30:00Z which will be recorded that will address any concerns on how to use these technologies and libraries. The session is in your course calendar and the meet link is meet.google.com/baz-ayij-ziy Kind regards

Post 52: @23F300327 Typically for a vercel application, and in particular for GA2-Q6, the applications are basically function calls. You are not expected to setup and run a local http server as you are doing in your code. When a call is made to the endpoint which in this scenario is /api with parameters, only one function is required, i.e the function that handles the get request. The rest is also automagically handled by vercel. There might be a conflict between vercel’s webserver deployment and the one you explicitly have encoded in your program. That’s why if you see in the course content about vercel, the simplest API service that you can launch with vercel looks something like this # api/index.py
import json
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler

class handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Content-type','application/json')
        self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(json.dumps({"message": "Hello!"}).encode('utf-8'))
        return Notice there is no if __name__ == "__main__": code block. This would instruct the interpreter that this is the starting point of your module. Clearly we do not want that, we want vercel to handle all the backend server stuff because vercel might be running some preflight code before it runs your application. if __name__ == "__main__": is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported. In vercel, it might not be the starting point of the application. Try rewriting it with just the required endpoint function inside the default handler class. Avoid custom named classes until you can get a working prototype working using the boilerplate that has been shared. Another possible problem: By default, the JSON module encodes Unicode objects (such as str and Unicode) into the \u escape sequence when generating JSON data. The GA however is expecting a serialised  UTF-8 JSON response instead. These might look the same on the screen but are not equivalent at the bytecode level. These encoding problems were covered in one of the videos that talked about encoding issues TDS > Development Tools > unicode So converting your output to UTF-8 might fix it. Let us know what worked. We are all learning from each other. Kind regards

Post 63: I’m not sure of the exact reason for the issue, but there are different ways to deploy to Vercel. One approach is using a vercel.json configuration file, and another is adding headers directly in the API code. You can follow Gui Bibeau’s guide to add CORS headers to your deployment setup. Also check the recording from yesterday’s session for more clarity in that session Carlton deployed application directly from github repository. If you’re still facing issues, you can join today’s session at 9 PM. For deploying a Flask or FastAPI app to Vercel, refer to this guide on DEV Community . I’ve tried both methods, and they work well.

Post 90: @23f1002382 Nothing unethical about using codespaces and public ports. You solved it. Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant. There is more than one way to skin a cat. That being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a “scientist”, its fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the “spirit of your question”. Most of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic essentials! So we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done. In the meanwhile: There are other great videos on the above channel, but these are probably the most relevant for us. Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything. Kind regards

Post 93: because it dynamically checks the answer each time a submit is done and if the ngrok tunnel and the service is not running at the time, then it marks it wrong. Since every student’s answer is going to be unique (unlike a mathematics question), by necessity we have to dynamically check the answer each submit. The workaround to prevent having to do it all over again, is to simply check all your answers that do not need active running servers first, then before doing a final save, run the servers for the required questions and the ngrok tunnel and submit to get the full marks. Just dont forget that your last save is what gets graded. Just ignore for now once you got it working. Solve all the other ones first and then for the final submission “get all your ducks in a row.” Kind regards

Post 94: hi @23f2003853 I think you are running your application server inside a virtual machine because of which it doesn’t have visibility to outside world(request coming from other domains).

3. **GET Request Handling**:
   - Sets CORS headers to allow requests from any origin.
   - Loads a JSON file named `q-vercel-python.json`.
   - Parses query parameters to check for a 'name' parameter.
   - If no 'name' is provided, it returns an error message.
   - If names are provided, it collects marks for those names from the JSON data and returns them.

4. **OPTIONS Request Handling**:
   - Handles preflight requests for CORS by setting appropriate headers.

Post 120: The issue might be with the IP address you’re using. Try using 127.0.0.1 and check if it’s the correct localhost IP for your machine. Also, test with http://localhost:8000/api to see if it works. If that doesn’t solve the problem and you’re running port 8000 inside a virtual machine, use the ipconfig command to check the correct IP address. We usually address doubts at the end of every session. Our next session is on the 31st—you can join then and ask your question if none of above solutions works.

Post 131: Hi Srividya, Thats right the idea behind vercel is you do not need to create a server. Its serverless! Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints. When the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs. This renders name == main part of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it). In other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to rethink how your application is designed. You do not create serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or MAD-2. This is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel. Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly help in deploying successful serverless applications. Thanks for your input. Kind regards

Post 146: @ carlton @ Jivraj Gentlemen! In GA2 answers, I have a problem. Question 10, the ngrok tunnel url was once correct and I saved it . When I revisited the GA2 again, the question 10 was marked incorrect. Do I need to do anything else ? Secondly the image comression file needs to be reloaded everytime I reconnect to the GA2. When I reload the last saved version, it does not take into the answer already saved. Third, the url link as given on publishing the page via github is obviously correct. But on checking, even after ?v = 1 …it does not work. Could you kindly look into them and advise if anything else needs to be done at my end? thanks & regards.

Post 149: In the ngrok question I was getting that same json error as everybody else since last 7 days or so. The ngrok link was working fine in browser every time but. Today i ran the LLama file with --n-gpu-layers 35 parameter at the end which makes it run using my laptops graphics card i guess. After i ran LLama file using this and ngrok later, my link was accepted in the GA 2 and i did not get any error after that. @carlton @Jivraj did this happen because i ran LLama file using my laptop GPU? This was suggested to me by another student who had the same problem.

Post 151: Try these @21f3000745 Download the data file once again and replace it with your current file, then deploy. If this doesn’t work, then: Try clicking on Check button once again. There are few cases where due to duplicity or other problems in the data, this bug occurs. The next check will most probably work. Reload the page, open the Networks Tab in the Inspect menu, click on Fetch/XHR filter button. Next click on check, if this error prompts up, you will get the request the system sent to check your answer. Copy that request and check on localhost.
