Question: Please post any questions related to Graded Assignment 2 - Deployment Tools . Important Instruction Please use markdown code formatting (fenced code blocks) when sharing code in Discourse posts. This makes the code much easier to read and differentiate from non-code text. It also makes it easier for people to copy code snippets and run it themselves. Visit this link for more details: Extended Syntax | Markdown Guide . A friendly suggestion: kindly go through Discourse Docs ! Deadline: Sunday, February 2, 2025 6:29 PM @carlton @Jivraj

Response 1: 

Response 2: Screenshot 2025-01-12 223630 1727×195 27.1 KB i have included the email address still its giving error

Image explanation: The image shows a question about the structure of a GitHub Pages URL. The example URL is provided as `https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/`, where `[USER]` represents the GitHub username and `[REPO]` represents the repository name.

Additionally, there's an error message indicating that the email address `22f3001315@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` is not found in the response, followed by HTML code including the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<meta>`, and `<title>` tags. The title of the page is "Dolphin Facts". The error likely indicates that the email address was expected in the response from the GitHub Pages server but was not found.

Response 3: Screenshot 2025-01-12 223956 1674×158 12.8 KB that website is working fine . just  write the parameters after /api

Image explanation: Here are the bounding box detections:
```json
[
  {"box_2d": [0, 5, 155, 515], "label": "text"},
  {"box_2d": [362, 14, 560, 250], "label": "text"},
  {"box_2d": [689, 9, 862, 152], "label": "text"}
]
```
Response 4: Hi Guddu, Can you share your GitHub repo. For GitHub pages question.

Response 5: Check your browser console most probably CORS is causing problem. Try adding CORS to your code it might work. Kind regards Jivraj

Response 6: github.com GitHub - gkmfrombs/dolfacts Contribute to gkmfrombs/dolfacts development by creating an account on GitHub. I have added email in body two times in different ways.

Image explanation: The image shows a GitHub repository named "dolfacts" belonging to the user "gkmfrombs". The repository has 1 contributor, 0 issues, 0 stars, and 0 forks. It also includes a repository icon with a green and gray square design.

Response 7: Screenshot 2025-01-14 at 1.39.39 AM 1440×900 154 KB @carlton can you please tell me what is wrong in this because I am getting “Error: Response undefined does not match expected” to my answer

Image explanation: The image shows a Python FastAPI application running with Uvicorn. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Code:** A Python script (`main.py`) using FastAPI to create an API endpoint `/api`. The endpoint `get_students` takes an optional list of classes as a query parameter. It reads student data from a CSV file, filters the students based on the provided classes, and returns the filtered or unfiltered list of students.
*   **Terminal Output (left):** Shows the Python code. The file being read is /Users/mish/Downloads/q-fastapi.csv.
*   **Terminal Output (right):** Shows Uvicorn running the application. It is accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. It also shows requests being made to the API (e.g., `/api`).
*   **Browser Window:** A web interface (presumably for testing the API) labeled "API application using Uvicorn". It likely includes components for submitting requests to the API.

In summary, the image shows the development and testing of a simple FastAPI application that serves student data, potentially filtered by class.
Response 8: Facing Issue in GA 2 Question 10 LLM ngrok image 1920×886 45.7 KB I tired multiple times but issue is still there. @carlton @Jivraj @s.anand Kindly help me out.

Image explanation: The image displays an error message from ngrok, a service that creates secure tunnels to expose local web servers to the internet. The error "ERR_NGROK_8012" indicates that while the tunnel to the ngrok agent was successful, the agent couldn't establish a connection to the upstream web service at http://localhost:8080. The specific error encountered was "dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8080: connect: connection refused," meaning there's no service listening on port 8080 on the local machine.

The page also provides guidance for developers and visitors experiencing this issue. For developers, it suggests ensuring a web service is running on http://localhost:8080 and verifying it by using cURL or opening the address in a browser. For visitors, it recommends waiting a few minutes and refreshing the page or contacting the developer if the problem persists.

Response 9: Hi Mishkat, Please use  triple backticks to encapsulate code, so that we can debug your code more easily. eg if __name__ == "__main__":
   print ("Hello") Please use this discourse etiquette to share code. Thanks and kind regards

Response 10: sir did you check yet what is the problem in this one?

Response 11: from fastapi import FastAPI, Query
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from typing import List, Optional
import csv

app = FastAPI()

# Enable CORS
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # Allow all origins
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],  # Allow all methods
    allow_headers=["*"],  # Allow all headers
)

# Load student data from the specified CSV file
students = []
with open('/Users/mish/Downloads/q-fastapi.csv', mode='r') as file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    for row in reader:
        students.append({
            "studentId": int(row["studentId"]),
            "class": row["class"]
        })

@app.get("/api")
async def get_students(class_: Optional[List[str]] = Query(None)):
    print(f"Requested classes: {class_}")  # Debugging line
    if class_:
        filtered_students = [student for student in students if student["class"] in class_]
        print(f"Filtered students: {filtered_students}")  # Debugging line
        return {"students": filtered_students}
    return {"students": students}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)

Response 12: Hi Mishkat, This error is because you are filtering on class_ instead of class So if you send a request on http://127.0.0.1/api?class_=1S you will see response for that 1S class only. kind regards

Response 13: thank you so much after modifying the code it got accepted

Response 14: Hi Guddu, Inside index.html file of your repo, don’t put html code just put your email in the file nothing else. This issue is because when you deploy on github pages it encrypts any email that’s on page. kind regards.

Response 15: I am facing an issue with Docker Desktop. Docker Desktop Error 558×377 27 KB I have uninstalled and installed Docker (run as administrator). wsl --version WSL version: 2.3.26.0
Kernel version: 5.15.167.4-1
WSLg version: 1.0.65
MSRDC version: 1.2.5620
Direct3D version: 1.611.1-81528511
DXCore version: 10.0.26100.1-240331-1435.ge-release
Windows version: 10.0.19045.5011 Tried many solutions after googling for the issue. So far no solution. Anyone else faced this issue and found a solution?

Image explanation: The image shows an error message from Docker Desktop related to the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). The error message states that an unexpected error occurred while executing a WSL command and suggests potential solutions such as shutting down WSL, rebooting the machine, or reinstalling WSL and/or Docker Desktop. It also provides a link to collect diagnostics and submit an issue. The error message also includes a snippet of the WSL deployment process, indicating an issue with importing the WSL distro "docker-desktop" because "WSL2 is not supported with". Finally, it has links to "Read our policy for uploaded diagnostic data" and buttons to "Gather diagnostics" and "Quit."

Response 16: Hi Telvin, Try opening localhost:8080 in browser if that works, if it opens in browser then issue might be with some network configurations. I solved this question in github codespace, which didn’t require me to make any changes in network. kind regards kind regards

Response 17: @Nelson I would recommend Podman or Docker CE rather than Docker Desktop . Docker Desktop is not free for organizations over 250 people and many organizations have therefore moved away from it.

Response 18: @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj I tired , in browser localhost:8080 is working fine but ngrok is not working. Is there any other tools for tunneling that can be used.

Response 19: @22f2001640 in that case a firewall or local security settings might block access to port 8080, or a network restriction is blocking access to port 8080 Please try one of these: Try the same on a personal laptop on a public / home network GitHub codespaces, as @Jivraj suggested You could try an ngrok alternative like localtunnel but I don’t think that’ll work.
