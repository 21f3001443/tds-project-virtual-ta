[View on Discourse](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/graded-assignment-1-submission-not-shown/165396)

Post 1: Hello, I submitted my graded assignment for TDS course. But unfortunately I did not see the question in the portal asking if I have seen all questions and attended the exam. Can someone please clarify if it shall be graded still? @carlton @Jivraj image 1340×527 17.9 KB image 1002×560 51.4 KB

Post 2: @Muthupalaniappan It is saying you did not attempt it because you did not answer the seek portal question. You are not graded on the seek portal question. It only exists to make sure you saw the GA and attempted it. You are only graded on your submission of GA1 on the actual assignment page where your last saved submission is used for grading. Kind regards

Post 3: Dear Sir, I encountered the same issue as mentioned. Could you please confirm whether GA 1 will still be evaluated under this condition, and if we will receive our actual score based on the last saved submission on the assignment page?

Post 7: Respected Sir, I made the similar mistake of not selecting a yes on the seek IITM portal According to your previous replies, does it imply that only the answers submitted through the link provided will be considered for evaluation regardless of the seek portal selection for this time? Thanks

Post 8: @23f2005471 Correct! Only scores that were saved in your actual last submission on the ga page itself will be evaluated (the portal question is just to make sure you were aware of the GA and confirm that you attempted it). Kind regards
