Response 1: GA2 - Deployment Tools - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025] Tools in Data Science We have removed that button, cause it was causing confusion among the students. 
If you have saved your answers on the TDS portal then you need not worry, you will be marked. The button was just there to ensure you saw the assignment on the TDS portal.

Response 2: I saved that too but right now scores of GA2 isn’t visible for me. And in score section it’s showing assignment not submitted. @Saransh_Saini

Response 3: Your scores are evaluated on a site that is external to the seek portal and is not integrated with the seek portal. Therefore seek does not know if you have submitted or not and by default says that it has not been submitted because it cannot see your external evaluation. There will not be a fix for this for some time. Scores for GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5, Project1, Project2, ROE will NOT be inside your seek portal. The scores will only be visible in the dashboard. Just ignore anything inside seek portal. The dashboard is where all your subject score cards exists. As stated in multiple places on discourse as well as in live sessions, The final score is always your last submission. If your dashboard score does not match your final submission score on the assignment page, only then contact us regarding your marks. Kind regards

Here's a description of what's in the image:

The image shows a webpage for a "Graded Assignment 3" exam. It's hosted on a site called "exam.sanand.workers.dev". The exam ended on Wednesday, February 5, 2025, at 11:59 PM IST. The current score is 0.

There are several important notes for the exam takers:
*   **Browser may struggle:** If there are loading issues, turning off security restrictions or trying a different browser is recommended.
*   **Use anything:** Any resources, including the Internet, ChatGPT, friends, libraries, or frameworks are allowed.
*   **It's hackable:** Hacking the code to get answers is allowed.
*   The exam runs multiple servers simultaneously while checking or saving answers.

There's a link to join a discussion on Discourse for questions. The user is logged in as "23f3004066@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" and has the option to logout.

The "Recent saves" section shows three previous saves with a score of 8 each from February 1, 2025, at different times.

Response 8: Dear Bhavanagv, The scores have not been pushed to the dashboard yet. Ignore seek portal. Seek portal will not have your submission or your scores because it is evaluated externally from the seek portal. Kind regards

Response 18: Only 1st Graded assignment scores are visible on dashboard.  I have submitted 2nd and 3rd GA before the deadline but still it showing “not submitted” on the seek portal…

Response 19: I recently got mail and checked my marks for GA2 and noticed that the final score is showing as 4.25 , but while attempting the assignment earlier, I had scored 7.25 shown after submission. Could you please help me understand how the marks were reduced? I want to ensure there was no error or misunderstanding in the evaluation.
