Response 1: 

Response 2: Screenshot 2025-02-01 132301 331×314 12.3 KB what is the error here?? sir @Jivraj

Image explanation: Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Content:**

1.  **JSON Data Snippet:** The image shows a snippet of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data. It represents information about a movie.

2.  **Data Fields:** The data includes the following fields:
    *   `id`:  The movie's unique identifier (likely an IMDb ID).
    *   `title`: The title of the movie.
    *   `year`: The year the movie was released.
    *   `rating`: The movie's rating.

3.  **Error message**: Error: Expected: 2.9 Actual: 2.9

**In summary, the image presents a JSON data example representing movie information, along with an error message.**
Response 3: I have the Same doubt.

Response 4: @22f3001315 @21f3002277 @24ds2000024 – please try again after reloading the page. The new error message will be clearer, like this: Error: At [0].rating: Values don't match. Expected: "7.4". Actual: 7.4 FYI, we expect all values as strings, not numbers. That’s because the year can sometimes be a range for a TV series (e.g. 2021 - 2024) and the rating can sometimes be missing.

Response 5: In Question 2, it is specifically said to filter the movies however, the evaluator is expecting a TV show there. Should we also include TV shows now? edit:  This is an everchanging dataset, so will our answers be saved, as, this json might not be in this order tomorrow?

Response 6: @23f2000237 A good point. Yes, please include all titles. I’ve reworded the question accordingly. Thanks.

Response 12: There is no submit button is available in below screen. Is it fine to save the link url only. Please clarify (unless we click submit button the log of Graded Assignment 4 remains red) image 1920×1080 337 KB

It also emphasizes the importance of using the correct student ID for the assignment.

Response 13: I have a doubt regarding the bonus mark. Suppose someone were to get 10/10 in the assignment, would their mark be recored as 11/10 or just 10? (Assuming they have interacted in this thread)

Response 14: Anyone scoring 10/10 on GA4 and replying with a relevant message on this thread will get 11/10

Response 15: For me I just made filter of rating between 2 and 7 in site and typed in console as per  video. with that data got in console worked fine. copy the coding and save in place use it for data extract when finally submit

In summary, the image shows a search interface where the user has entered the title "Un matrimonio di troppo" as a search filter, but the search returned no results.
Response 17: how to get the BBC weather API key?

Response 18: Just a quick query on the Bonus mark. Would this be added to the final grade? Say for example, Someone get a full score in the first 4 assignments. So the total comes up to 39.5/39.5, and would be converted to 0.15 or 15 marks. Would the bonus mark be additional to that 15 or would the score change to 40.5/39.5 and then get normalised to 15?

Response 19: @JoelJeffrey It will be added to the GA4 marks, not the final grade. So, it’s roughly worth 0.15% on the total - not a full 1% on the total.
