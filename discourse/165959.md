Post 6: @22f3001315 @21f3002277 @24ds2000024 – please try again after reloading the page. The new error message will be clearer, like this: Error: At [0].rating: Values don't match. Expected: "7.4". Actual: 7.4 FYI, we expect all values as strings, not numbers. That’s because the year can sometimes be a range for a TV series (e.g. 2021 - 2024) and the rating can sometimes be missing.

Post 7: In Question 2, it is specifically said to filter the movies however, the evaluator is expecting a TV show there. Should we also include TV shows now? edit:  This is an everchanging dataset, so will our answers be saved, as, this json might not be in this order tomorrow?

Post 21: Just a quick query on the Bonus mark. Would this be added to the final grade? Say for example, Someone get a full score in the first 4 assignments. So the total comes up to 39.5/39.5, and would be converted to 0.15 or 15 marks. Would the bonus mark be additional to that 15 or would the score change to 40.5/39.5 and then get normalised to 15?
[View on Discourse](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga4-data-sourcing-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/165959/21)


Post 22: @JoelJeffrey It will be added to the GA4 marks, not the final grade. So, it’s roughly worth 0.15% on the total - not a full 1% on the total.

Post 119: I think the idea behind this font is to make it difficult for people to manually work on the markdown file from scratch. I guess they want us to use the tools (like PyMuPDF4LLM, markitdown) they provided as resources to convert pdf into a markdown and then may be we can do some manual intervention to make it to the result as the scraping tools are not 100% accurate. Could be another reason too. TAs’ can feel free to pitch in.

Post 140: @21F1005510 Actually, some IMDb titles have multiple names. For example, The Recruit is also known as Graymail in India . My server checks from a different region from yours. Hence the need for manual corrections for a few titles. Why didn’t I pick an exercise that could be fully automated? Because this is how real-life data sourcing is. It’s never perfect. You often need to create workflows where you’re able to quickly correct such errors in automation.

Post 148: Sir, In Graded Assignment - 4 >> Q2, the year I extracted appears as “2024,” whereas the expected value on the portal is “2024–”. I have manually adjusted several values based on the expected format. This issue is specific to the year field. I use different classes to extract values for various fields. Could there be any other element on the portal affecting this extraction? In Q4, one of my classmates is encountering a “root property” error despite using the same extraction method as I do. Upon checking, I found that this issue occurs because the city’s time is displayed as the previous day compared to our time. The portal results seem to be based on the city’s actual time rather than IST. I would appreciate your guidance on these issues.

Post 200: you have to manually change for a few mismatch. s.anand: @21F1005510 Actually, some IMDb titles have multiple names. For example, The Recruit is also known as Graymail in India . My server checks from a different region from yours. Hence the need for manual corrections for a few titles. Why didn’t I pick an exercise that could be fully automated? Because this is how real-life data sourcing is. It’s never perfect. You often need to create workflows where you’re able to quickly correct such errors in automation.

Post 203: The API is returning 14 days of forecast data, as evidenced by the output However, the issueDate values are not unique for each day. Instead, they represent the time when the forecast was issued or updated. In your output, there are only two unique issueDate values: 2025-02-08T04:00:00-05:00 2025-02-08T16:01:58-05:00 This means the forecast was updated twice on February 8, 2025, once at 04:00 AM and again at 4:01 PM (both in EST timezone) …To get a unique weather description for each day, you  need to modify your approach by using the actual forecast day for each day instead.

Post 236: Agreed and I have tweaked my approach to get the correct answer. But I feel the question instructions should be adjusted accordingly - the question says to get every issueDate and enhancedweatherDescription key value pair - but only 2 such pairs exist ; whereas in the final answer it is forecast date & weather description total 14  pairs.

Post 237: Screenshot (7) 1366×768 243 KB Open the BBC Weather website. Press Ctrl + Shift + I . Select the ‘Network’ menu. Select ‘Fetch/XHR’. Type ‘Karachi’ in the input field on the website. Do not press Enter while entering the location; just type the location. Pressing Enter might cause ‘location?api_key=…’ to disappear. ‘location?api_key=…’ will appear in the inspect menu. Double-click it to open a web page ( https://locator-service.api.bbci.co.uk/locations?api_key={api_key} ). This will give the API. Alternatively, single-clicking ‘location?api_key=…’ will open headers where you can see the Request URL and the API key.
![The image shows a screenshot of a computer screen with multiple elements:

1. **Web Browser**: The browser is open to the BBC Weather website, specifically showing weather information for Karachi, Pakistan.

2. **Tabs**: Several tabs are open at the top, including "My Drive," "Graded A," "TDS 2023," and others.

3. **Developer Tools**: The right side of the screen displays the browser's developer tools, specifically the "Network" tab. It shows network activity, including requests and responses.

4. **Weather Graphic**: A graphic on the BBC Weather page shows a map with weather forecasts for various cities around the world, including London, Tbilisi, San José, and others.

5. **Windows Activation**: A notification at the bottom right indicates that Windows needs to be activated.

Overall, the screenshot captures a user browsing the BBC Weather site while inspecting network activity using developer tools.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/9/5/954c6fa15e0841c485fc497035ecb4805336f0cb_2_690x387.png)

Post 305: Alright so in Q4 of W4, We have to extract weather forecast data from bbc servers for a given city. The city I have been given Nur-Sultan is not present in the bbc data base, it appears the city is now known as Astana and is listed in the bbc database as Astana.

So I extracted the data for Astana and pasted it in the portal but that doesn’t work as well and throws the following error “TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading ‘id’)” What am I suppose to do? @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Screenshot 2025-02-09 175948 1823×850 82.3 KB Below is the data for Astana that I was able to extract, Since Nur-Sultan doesn’t exist in the bbc database: { “2025-02-09”: “Partly cloudy and a moderate breeze”, “2025-02-10”: “Sunny intervals and a moderate breeze”, “2025-02-11”: “Sunny and a gentle breeze”, “2025-02-12”: “Light snow and a fresh breeze”, “2025-02-13”: “Light snow and a fresh breeze”, “2025-02-14”: “Light snow and a gentle breeze”, “2025-02-15”: “Light snow and a gentle breeze”, “2025-02-16”: “Light snow and a gentle breeze”, “2025-02-17”: “Light cloud and a gentle breeze”, “2025-02-18”: “Sunny intervals and a gentle breeze”, “2025-02-19”: “Light cloud and a gentle breeze”, “2025-02-20”: “Light cloud and a gentle breeze”, “2025-02-21”: “Sunny and a moderate breeze”, “2025-02-22”: “Light snow and a moderate breeze” }

You will start seeing them in the dashboard soon. 
Also these are the list of students that have been affected by Nur-Sultan in their questions. These will get an automatic mark for that question if they attempted it. Note that this is not a bonus mark. This is a free mark.

Post 391: For those who didn’t submit but still need to practice the questions like to check if the answer is right, or cross-check the solutions for GA 4 and GA 5, is there a special link where the portal just checks the answer and says right or wrong. I wasn’t able to do GA4 or even try to attempt GA 5 before deadline, but i would like to go through the process of submitting etc. is there any link or solutions for GA 4 and GA5.

Post 392: is there anyway to practice the assignments and check answers even though the deadline for the assignment passes? or is the answer given somewhere just for learning sake. I  understand that each set of students get different questions. @Jivraj @carlton @s.anand
