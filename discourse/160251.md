![The image shows a course summary for "Tools in Data Science." It lists assignment scores for six weeks, with one score missing due to absence. The average assignment score is 100.00, which makes the student eligible for the end-term exam. The programming quiz is marked as absent. The student is allowed to take the end-term exam. There's also a button to go to the course page.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/f/d/fdd8977eb016b9e2e91e5373546b1f2a6c5dc914.png)

Post 2: Sir @s.anand @carlton even the final score is released and grade is visible but not change is made in the PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1 status yet. I got 70% score in that but it is showing absent instead. It affected my grade severely sir , I would’ve gotten A grade according to that but because the PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1 score is not calculated it is showing C grade. Please help me with this issue sir , I will be really grateful . Again a recent screenshot of TDS dashboard view . image 496×630 38.5 KB Thanking you
