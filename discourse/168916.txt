Response 13: Screenshot 2025-03-29 at 11.24.19 pm 811×206 29.2 KB You failed pre requisites check. Hence there is no evaluation email. i.e. the score is 0 which will be pushed to dashboard on after 1/4/25 Only those that passed the pre requisite check got emails with scores.

Image explanation: The image shows a table with information about emails, URLs, results, types, and messages. The table appears to be some kind of report or log. The entries in the table include email addresses, URLs pointing to GitHub repositories, results (OK or FAIL), types (like Docker, Repo, License, Dockerfile, Clone), and messages describing the outcome of some process.  Specifically, the messages include details about DockerHub images, the existence of repositories and license files, and cloning.
